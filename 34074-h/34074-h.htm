<h3>KEY TO PRONUNCIATION</h3>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

  <p>The method of marking pronunciations here employed is either (1) by
  marking the syllable on which the accent falls, or (2) by a simple system
  of transliteration, to which the following is the Key:&mdash;</p>

<h3>VOWELS</h3>

  <p>&#x101;, as in f<i>a</i>te, or in b<i>a</i>re.</p>

  <p>ä, as in <i>a</i>lms, Fr. <i>â</i>me, Ger. B<i>a</i>hn = á of Indian
  names.</p>

  <p>a<span class="x1"><span class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>, the same
  sound short or medium, as in Fr. b<i>a</i>l, Ger. M<i>a</i>nn.</p>

  <p>a, as in f<i>a</i>t.</p>

  <p>a<span class="x1"><span class="x3">&#xA8;</span></span>, as in
  f<i>a</i>ll.</p>

  <p><i>a</i>, obscure, as in rur<i>a</i>l, similar to <i>u</i> in
  b<i>u</i>t, &#x117; in h<i>e</i>r: common in Indian names.</p>

  <p>&#x113;, as in m<i>e</i> = <i>i</i> in mach<i>i</i>ne.</p>

  <p>e, as in m<i>e</i>t.</p>

  <p>&#x117;, as in h<i>e</i>r.</p>

  <p>&#x12B;, as in p<i>i</i>ne, or as <i>ei</i> in Ger. m<i>ei</i>n.</p>

  <p>i, as in p<i>i</i>n, also used for the short sound corresponding to
  &#x113;, as in French and Italian words.</p>

  <p><i>eu</i>, a long sound as in Fr. j<i>eû</i>ne = Ger. long <i>ö</i>,
  as in S<i>ö</i>hne, G<i>ö</i>the (Goethe).</p>

  <p>eu, corresponding sound short or medium, as in Fr. p<i>eu</i> = Ger.
  <i>ö</i> short.</p>

  <p>&#x14D;, as in n<i>o</i>te, m<i>oa</i>n.</p>

  <p>o, as in n<i>o</i>t, s<i>o</i>ft&mdash;that is, short or medium.</p>

  <p>ö, as in m<i>o</i>ve, tw<i>o</i>.</p>

  <p>&#x16B; as in t<i>u</i>be.</p>

  <p>u, as in t<i>u</i>b: similar to &#x117; and also to <i>a</i>.</p>

  <p>u<span class="x1"><span class="x3">&#xA8;</span></span>, as in
  b<i>u</i>ll.</p>

  <p>ü, as in Sc. ab<i>u</i>ne = Fr. <i>û</i> as in d<i>û</i>, Ger.
  <i>ü</i> long as in gr<i>ü</i>n, B<i>ü</i>hne.</p>

  <p>u<span class="x1"><span class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>, the
  corresponding short or medium sound, as in Fr. b<i>u</i>t, Ger.
  M<i>ü</i>ller.</p>

  <p>oi, as in <i>oi</i>l.</p>

  <p>ou, as in p<i>ou</i>nd; or as <i>au</i> in Ger. H<i>au</i>s.</p>

<h3>CONSONANTS</h3>

  <p>Of the <i>consonants</i>, <b>b,</b> <b>d,</b> <b>f,</b> <b>h,</b>
  <b>j,</b> <b>k,</b> <b>l,</b> <b>m,</b> <b>n,</b> <b>ng,</b> <b>p,</b>
  <b>sh,</b> <b>t,</b> <b>v,</b> <b>z,</b> always have their common English
  sounds, when used to transliterate foreign words. The letter <b>c</b> is
  not used by itself in re-writing for pronunciation, <b>s</b> or <b>k</b>
  being used instead. The only consonantal symbols, therefore, that require
  explanation are the following:&mdash;</p>

  <p>ch is always as in ri<i>ch</i>.</p>

  <p><i>d</i>, nearly as <i>th</i> in <i>th</i>is = Sp. <i>d</i> in
  Ma<i>d</i>ri<i>d</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>g is always hard, as in <i>g</i>o.</p>

  <p><i>h</i> represents the guttural in Scotch lo<i>ch</i>, Ger.
  na<i>ch</i>, also other similar gutturals.</p>

  <p>n<span class="x1"><span class="x3">&#x2D9;</span></span>, Fr. nasal
  <i>n</i> as in bo<i>n</i>.</p>

  <p>r represents both English <i>r</i>, and <i>r</i> in foreign words,
  which is generally much more strongly trilled.</p>

  <p>s, always as in <i>s</i>o.</p>

  <p>th, as <i>th</i> in <i>th</i>in.</p>

  <p><i>th</i>, as <i>th</i> in <i>th</i>is.</p>

  <p>w always consonantal, as in <i>w</i>e.</p>

  <p>x = ks, which are used instead.</p>

  <p>y always consonantal, as in <i>y</i>ea (Fr. <i>ligne</i> would be
  re-written l&#x113;ny).</p>

  <p>zh, as <i>s</i> in plea<i>s</i>ure = Fr. <i>j</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Amiel´</b>, Henri Frédéric, French-Swiss philosophical writer and
  poet, born at Geneva, 1821, died there 1881. Educated at Geneva, he
  resided a considerable time abroad, especially in Germany, and was much
  influenced by German thought and science. On his return he first held the
  chair of æsthetics, and then that of philosophy. He published several
  volumes of poetry as well as other works, but he is best known by his
  <i>Journal Intime</i>, published after his death, and translated into
  English (1885), with a critical study by Mrs. Humphry Ward. It shows
  great critical and philosophical power, but is pessimistic.</p>

  <p><b>Am´meter</b> (short for ampere-meter), an instrument used for the
  measurement of electric currents. For commercial use the scale is marked
  so as to read amperes directly, but for experimental purposes it is usual
  to have a scale with divisions numbered in tens, in which case the
  reading multiplied by a suitable constant gives the value of the current
  in amperes. By employing suitable shunts this admits of the one
  instrument being used for a number of ranges.</p>

  <p>The types of ammeter and the principles upon which they work are as
  follows: (<i>a</i>) <i>Soft-iron type</i>, the action of a magnetic field
  on a piece of soft iron; (<i>b</i>) <i>moving-coil type</i> and
  <i>dynamometer type</i>, the action of a magnetic field on a
  current-carrying coil; (<i>c</i>) <i>hot-wire type</i>, the expansion of
  a conductor due to the heating produced by the current; (<i>d</i>)
  <i>induction type</i>, the action of a magnetic field on the eddy
  currents produced in a metal disc.</p>

  <p>The "soft-iron" ammeter can be used for both direct and alternating
  currents, is inexpensive, and is sufficiently accurate for commercial
  use.</p>

  <p>For direct-current measurements where a high degree of accuracy is of
  first importance, a "moving-coil" ammeter is invariably used.</p>

  <p>In alternating-current circuits its place is taken by the dynamometer
  type, which reads both direct and alternating currents.</p>

  <p>In cases where absence of inductance in the instrument is important,
  e.g. in the measurements in wireless-telegraph and telephone circuits,
  the "hot-wire" ammeter is used. It measures both direct and alternating
  currents, and, when properly used, has a high degree of accuracy.</p>

  <p>The "induction" type cannot be used for direct currents, and has the
  limitation that with alternating currents it will read correctly only at
  the frequency for which it is calibrated.</p>

  <p>Almost invariably an ammeter gives its full-scale reading when a small
  current, say of the order of one-tenth of an ampere, is passing through
  the instrument itself. In order to read larger currents a device is
  employed whereby a definite fraction of the current to be measured <!--

    Ammon.
  </div>

  <p><b>Am´mon</b> (often called <b>Ammon-Ra</b>, i.e. Ammon-Sun), an
  ancient Egyptian deity, one of the chief gods of the country, identified
  by the Greeks with their supreme god Zeus, while the Romans regarded him
  as the representative of Jupiter; represented as a ram, as a human being
  with a ram's head, ornamented with the solar disc, or simply with the
  horns of a ram. There was a celebrated temple of Ammon in the Oasis of
  Siwah in the Libyan desert.</p>

  <p><b>Ammon</b>, Oasis of. See <i>Siwah</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Ammo´nia</b>, an alkaline substance, which differs from the other
  alkalies by being gaseous, and is hence sometimes called the <i>volatile
  alkali</i>. It is a colourless pungent gas, composed of nitrogen and
  hydrogen; formula, NH<sub>3</sub>. It was first prepared by Priestley,
  who termed it <i>alkaline air</i>. He obtained it from sal-ammoniac by
  the action of lime, by which method it is yet generally prepared. It is
  used for many purposes, both in medicine and scientific chemistry; not,
  however, in the gaseous state, but frequently in solution in water, under
  the names of <i>liquid ammonia</i>, <i>aqueous ammonia</i>, or <i>spirits
  of hartshorn</i>. It is generally prepared from the ammoniacal liquor
  obtained as a by-product on distilling coal. Combined with acids, ammonia
  forms salts which are of immense value to agriculture. The well-known
  odour of farmyard manure is very largely due to the formation of ammonia
  during the rotting of the dung. Many animal substances, such as bones,
  clippings and shavings of horn, hoof, &amp;c., and certain vegetable
  matters yield ammonia when heated. Sal-ammoniac is ammonium chloride.</p>

  <p><b>Ammoni´&#x103;cum</b>, a gum-resinous exudation from an
  umbelliferous plant, the <i>Dor&#x113;ma ammoni&#x103;cum</i>. It has a
  fetid smell, is inflammable, soluble in water and spirit of wine; used as
  an antispasmodic, stimulant, and expectorant in chronic catarrh,
  bronchitic affections, and asthma; also used for plasters.</p>

  <p><b>Ammo´niaphone</b>, an instrument, consisting of a metallic tube
  containing some substance saturated with ammonia, peroxide of hydrogen,
  and a few flavouring compounds, fitted with a mouthpiece to breathe
  through, which is said to render the voice strong, clear, rich, and
  ringing by the inhalation of the ammoniacal vapour. It was invented by
  Dr. Carter Moffat, and was suggested by the presence of ammonia in some
  quantity in the atmosphere of Italy&mdash;the country of fine
  singers.</p>

  <p><b>Am´monites</b>, a group of fossil cephalopods, now divided into a
  large number of genera, ranging from the Coal Measures (Texas) to the
  uppermost cretaceous strata. The ammonites differ from the nautili in
  having the tube connecting the chambers placed on the outer margin of the
  coiled shell, while the calcareous neck where it passes through the
  partitions is directed forwards. The partitions are much folded,
  producing markings like the fronds of ferns where they meet the inner
  wall of the shell. The name arises from confusion with a coiled
  gastropod, which was held to resemble the horns of the Egyptian deity
  Jupiter Ammon.</p>

  <p><b>Am´monites</b>, a Semitic race frequently mentioned in Scripture,
  descended from Ben-Ammi, the son of Lot (<i>Gen.</i> xix, 38), often
  spoken of in conjunction with the Moabites. A predatory and Bedouin race,
  they inhabited the desert country east of Gad, their chief city being
  Rabbath-Ammon (Philadelphia). Wars between the Israelites and the
  Ammonites were frequent; they were overcome by Jephthah, Saul, David,
  Uzziah, Jotham, &amp;c. They appear to have existed as a distinct people
  in the time of Justin Martyr, but have subsequently become merged in the
  aggregate of nameless Arab tribes.</p>

  <p><b>Ammo´nium</b>, the name given to the hypothetical radicle (formula,
  NH<sub>4</sub>) of ammonium salts. It functionates as a metal, has not
  been isolated, but it is believed to exist in an amalgam with
  mercury.</p>

  <p><b>Ammo´nius Sac´cas</b>, a Greek philosopher who lived about <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 175-240. Originally a porter in Alexandria, he
  derived his epithet from the carrying of <i>sacks</i> of corn. The son of
  Christian parents, he abandoned their faith for the polytheistic
  philosophy of Greece. His teaching was historically a transition stage
  between Platonism and Neo-Platonism. Among his disciples were Plotinus,
  Longinus, Origen, &amp;c. The books often attributed to him are by a
  Christian philosopher of the same name. <!-- Page 145 --><span

  <p><b>Ammuni´tion</b>, another form of the word munition, with a more
  restricted meaning. It is now taken to include cartridges of all sorts
  for guns, howitzers, rifles, and all fire-arms. Ammunition comprises both
  cartridges in which explosive and missiles are combined to form one
  compact article, and also other forms of projectiles of which the
  explosive agent forms one portion and the actual missile the other.
  Bombs, grenades, shells, powder, and bullets are all included in the
  generic term ammunition. As a qualifying word used adjectivally it is
  found in ammunition-wagon, ammunition-carrier, ammunition-mules,
  ammunition-column, &amp;c. In the British service the Royal Army Ordnance
  Corps is entrusted with the provision of supplies of ammunition
  generally, while the actual distribution in the field is the duty of the

  into finger-like processes or pseudopodia, and by means of these moves
  about or grasps particles of food. There is no distinct mouth, and food
  is engulfed within any portion of the soft sarcode body. Reproduction
  takes place by fission, or by a single pseudopodium detaching itself from
  the parent body and developing into a separate am&oelig;ba.</p>

  <p><b>Ampere</b> (am´p&#x101;r), in electricity, the unit employed in
  measuring the strength or intensity of an electric current, being
  equivalent to the current produced by the electro-motive force of one
  volt in a wire having the resistance of one ohm. The name (cf.
  <i>Farad</i>, <i>Coulomb</i>, <i>Watt</i>, &amp;c.) is derived from that
  of the well-known physicist, Ampère. An <i>ampere-meter</i> or
  <i>ammeter</i> is an instrument by which the strength of an electric

  <p><b>Amphib´ia</b>, a class of vertebrate animals, which in their early
  life breathe by gills or branchiæ, and afterwards partly or entirely by
  lungs. The Frog, breathing in its tadpole state by gills and afterwards
  throwing off these organs and breathing entirely by lungs in its adult
  state, is an example of the latter phase of amphibian existence. The
  Proteus of the underground caves of Central Europe exemplifies forms in
  which the gills of early life are retained throughout life, and in which
  lungs are developed in addition to the gills. A second character of this
  group consists in the presence of two occipital 'condyles', or processes
  by means of which the skull articulates with the spine or vertebral
  column; Reptiles possessing one condyle only. The class is divided into
  four orders: the Ophiomorpha (or serpentiform), represented by the
  Blindworms, in which limbs are wanting and the body is snake-like; the
  Urodela or 'Tailed' Amphibians, including the Newts, Proteus, Siren,
  &amp;c.; the Anoura, or Tailless Amphibia, represented by the Frogs and
  Toads; and the Labyrinthodontia, which includes the extinct forms known
  as Labyrinthodons. The term Amphibia was originally employed by Linnæus
  in his <i>Systema Naturæ</i>, and adopted by Cuvier in his <i>Tableau
  Elémentaire</i>. See <i>Batrachia</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Amphibol´ogy</b>, in logic, an equivocal phrase or sentence, not

  twelve northern tribes which met alternately at Delphi and Thermopylæ.
  The tribes sent two deputies each, who assembled with great solemnity;
  composed the public dissensions, and the quarrels of individual cities,
  by force or persuasion; punished civil and criminal offences, and
  particularly transgressions of the law of nations, and violations of the
  temple of Delphi. Its calling on the States to punish the Phocians for

  sixteenth century. It has considerable manufactures of shawls and silks;
  and receives its name from the sacred pond constructed by Ram Das, the
  apostle of the Sikhs, in which the Sikhs and other Hindus immerse
  themselves that they may be purified from all sin. Pop.

  <p><b>Am´ru</b>, originally an opponent, and subsequently a zealous
  supporter of Mahomet, and one of the ablest of the Mahommedan warriors.
  He brought Egypt under the power of the Caliph Omar in 638, and governed
  it wisely till his death in 663. The burning of the famous Alexandrian
  Library has been generally attributed to him, though only on the
  authority of a writer who lived six centuries later.</p>

  <p><b>Am´sterdam</b> (that is, 'the dam of the Amstel'), one of the chief
  commercial cities of Europe, capital of Holland (but not the residence of
  the sovereign), situated at the confluence of the Amstel with the Y or
  Ij, an arm of the Zuider-Zee. On account of the lowness of the site of
  the city the greater part of it is built on piles. It is divided by
  numerous canals into about 90 islands, which are connected by nearly 300
  bridges. Many of the streets have a canal in the middle with broad
  brick-paved quays on either side, planted with rows of trees; the houses
  are generally of brick, many of them six or seven stories high, with
  pointed gables turned to the streets. Among the public buildings are the
  old stadthouse, the work of Jacob van Kempen, commenced in 1648 and
  finished in 1655, which is now a royal palace, the interior being
  decorated by the Dutch painters and sculptors of the seventeenth century
  with their masterpieces; the justiciary hall, an imitation of a Greek
  temple; the town hall (fourteenth century); the exchange, a handsome
  building, constructed in 1836 on the site of the old bourse built in
  1608; the Palace of National Industry; the national museum; and the
  central railway station. The old church is a structure of the fourteenth
  century with stained-glass windows painted by Digman in the fifteenth
  century. The chief educational institutions of the kingdom are here,
  including the city university, a free university, gymnasiums and other
  secondary schools, the national picture gallery or museum, containing
  many masterpieces of Dutch artists, &amp;c. Among its numerous industries
  may be mentioned as a speciality the cutting and polishing of diamonds.
  It has also factories and workshops dealing with wool, cotton, silk,
  tobacco, leather, machinery, and metal goods, glass, liqueurs, cocoa,
  &amp;c. The harbour, formed by the Y, lies along the whole of the north
  side of the city, and is surrounded by various docks and basins. The
  trade is very great, being much facilitated by the great ship-canal (15
  miles long, opened 1876, admitting the largest vessels) connecting the Y
  directly with the North Sea at Y-Muiden, where the entrance is between
  two long piers projecting into the sea. Another canal of much less
  importance, the North Holland Canal (46 miles long, 20 feet deep),
  connects Amsterdam with the Helder. Between the harbour and the Zuider
  Zee the Y is now crossed by a great dam in which are locks to admit
  vessels and regulate the amount of water in the North Sea Canal. The
  oversea trade of Amsterdam has immensely increased since the opening of
  the great canal, and the foreign trade of the kingdom practically centres
  in Amsterdam and Rotterdam. There is also a large trade with the interior
  by railway, river, and canal. In the beginning of the thirteenth century
  Amsterdam was but a fishing village. In the fourteenth and fifteenth
  centuries it had attained some importance, especially through the Baltic
  trade. The ruin of Antwerp through the troubles with Spain was greatly to
  its advantage, and during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
  Amsterdam was one of the wealthiest and most flourishing cities in the
  world. Its forced alliance with France ruined its trade, but since 1813
  its commerce has revived. Amsterdam is the birthplace of Spinoza and of
  the painters van de Velde and van der Neer. Pop. (1919), 647,120.</p>

  <p><b>Amundsen</b>, Captain Roald, Norwegian polar explorer, born at
  Borge, Norway, 16th July, 1872. He was first-lieutenant on the
  <i>Belgica</i> during the Belgian south polar expedition, 1897-9. He then
  planned an expedition to the area of the north magnetic pole and a
  north-west passage by water. On 17th June, 1903, he embarked from
  Christiania on the small sailing vessel the <i>Gjöa</i>, with a company
  of six men, and reached King William Land, where the vessel remained for
  two years. Here he made his headquarters, and by numerous excursions was
  able to prove that the north magnetic pole has no stationary position,
  but is in continual movement. On 11th July, 1906, his vessel reached the
  Behring Strait, and on 30th August entered the Pacific. After his return
  Amundsen began his preparations for an Antarctic expedition, and on 9th
  August, 1910, he sailed from Norway on Nansen's ship, the <i>Fram</i>,
  and reached the South Pole on 7th March, 1912. He published an account of
  his North-West Passage expedition, entitled <i>Sydpolen. Den norske

  <p><b>Anabap´tists</b> (from the Gr. <i>anabaptizein</i>, to rebaptize),
  a name given to a Christian sect by their adversaries, because, as they
  objected to infant baptism, they rebaptized those who joined their body.
  Their doctrine is based upon the words of Christ in <i>St. Mark</i>, xvi,
  16. The founder of the sect appears to have been Nicolas Storch, a
  disciple of Luther's, who seems to have aimed also at the reorganization
  of society based on civil and political equality. Gathering round him a
  number of fiery spirits, among whom was Thomas Münzer, he incited the
  peasantry of Suabia and Franconia to insurrection&mdash;the doctrine of a
  community of goods being now added to their creed. This insurrection was
  quelled in 1525, when Münzer was put to the torture and beheaded. After
  the death of Münzer the sectaries dispersed in all directions, spreading
  their doctrines wherever they went. In 1534 the town of Münster in
  Westphalia became their centre of action. Under the leadership of
  Bockhold and Matthias their numbers increased daily, and being joined by
  the restless spirits of the adjoining towns, they soon made themselves
  masters of the town and expelled their adversaries. Matthias became their
  prophet, but he fell in a sally against the Bishop of Münster, Count
  Waldeck, who had laid siege to the city. Bockhold then became leader,
  assuming the name of John of Leyden, King of the New Jerusalem, and
  Münster became a theatre of all the excesses of fanaticism, lust, and
  cruelty. The town was eventually taken (June, 1535), and Bockhold and a
  great many of his partisans suffered death. This was the last time that
  the movement assumed anything like political importance. In the meantime
  some of the apostles, who were sent out by Bockhold to extend the limits
  of his kingdom, had been successful in various places, and many
  independent teachers, who preached the same doctrines, continued active
  in the work of founding a new empire of pure Christians. It is true that
  they rejected the practice of polygamy, community of goods, and
  intolerance towards those of different opinions which had prevailed in
  Münster; but they enjoined upon their adherents the other doctrines of
  the early Anabaptists, and certain heretical opinions in regard to the
  humanity of Christ, occasioned by the controversies of that day about the
  sacrament. The most celebrated of those Anabaptist prophets were Melchior
  Hoffmann, the founder of the Hoffmannists or Millenarians; Galenus
  Abrahamssohn, from whom the sect of the Galenists were called; and Simon
  Menno, founder of various sects known as Mennonites. Menno's principles
  are contained in his <i>Principles of the True Christian Faith</i>
  (1556), a work which is held as authoritative on points of doctrine and
  worship among the Baptist communities at the present day. The application
  of the term Anabaptist to the general body of Baptists throughout the
  world is unwarranted, because these sects have nothing in common with the
  bodies which sprung up in various countries of Europe during the
  Reformation, except the practice of adult baptism. The Baptists
  themselves repudiate the name Anabaptist, as they claim to baptize
  according to the original institution of the rite, and never repeat
  baptism in the case of those who in their opinion have been so baptized.
  It is under the designation of Mennonites that they exist to-day,
  principally in Holland, Germany, and the United States.</p>

  <p><b>Anæ´mia</b> (Gr., 'want of blood'), a medical term applied to an

  want of appetite, fainting, palpitation, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Anæsthe´sia</b>, or <b>Anæsthe´sis</b>, a state of insensibility to
  pain, produced by inhaling chloroform, or by the application of other
  anæsthetic agents.</p>

  <p><b>Anæsthet´ics</b> are medical agents chiefly used in surgical
  operations for the abolition of pain. They are divided into (1)
  <i>general anæsthetics</i>, those in which complete unconsciousness is
  produced; (2) <i>local anæsthetics</i>, those which act upon the nerves
  of a limited area alone.</p>

  <p>The earliest record of attempts to produce anæsthesia is to be found
  in the thirteenth century. Since then many agents have been tried. The
  first scientific effort was in 1800, when Sir Humphry Davy experimented
  with nitrous oxide, but without practical result. In 1844 Wells, an
  American dentist, used nitrous oxide, also without result. In 1846
  Morton, another American dentist, used ether, and from that time it was
  increasingly used in America. In the same year the first operation under
  ether was performed in University College Hospital, London. In 1847 Sir
  James Simpson (Edinburgh) introduced chloroform. Through his influence it
  was soon largely used throughout England and Scotland, and continued to
  be the chief anæsthetic till about the end of the nineteenth century,
  when ether again became popular in England. To-day, in England, as always
  in the United States, ether is the most widely-used anæsthetic. Much
  controversy exists regarding the respective merits of ether and
  chloroform. The general opinion is, that ether is on the whole safer, but
  more liable, in the British climate, to be followed by bronchitis; while
  there are various conditions when chloroform is still preferable. They
  are frequently combined in use. <i>Nitrous-oxide gas</i> (laughing gas)
  is much used in dentistry. Lately, nitrous oxide has been used with
  ether; while ether and oxygen together were <!-- Page 152 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page152"></a>[152]</span>much used with the
  British Expeditionary Force in France during the European War (1914-8).
  The administration of all anæsthetics is helped when the patient is given
  a hypodermic injection of morphia shortly before. <i>Twilight sleep</i>,
  increasingly used in childbirth, is the production of a partial
  anæsthesia by the administration of scopolamin morphine. <i>Local
  anæsthetics</i> are much used in minor surgery, and with proper technique
  act effectively. Cocaine was the first of these, and is still widely
  used. Of later developments, eucaine and novocaine are best known. Spinal
  anæsthesia is the injection of stovaine or similar substance into the
  spinal cord, producing anæsthesia of a large part of the body, varying
  according to the site of the injection.</p>

  so as to form a new word or phrase, a connection in meaning being
  frequently preserved; thus, <i>evil</i>, <i>vile</i>; <i>Horatio

  <p><b>Analep´tic</b>, a restorative or invigorating medicine or diet.</p>

  <p><b>An´alogue</b>, in comparative anatomy an organ in one species or
  group having the same function as an organ of different structure in
  another species or group, as the wing of a bird and that of an insect,
  both serving for flight. Organs in different animals having a similar
  anatomical structure, development, and relative position, independent of
  function or form, such as the arm of a man and the wing of a bird, are
  termed <i>homologues</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Anal´ogy</b> is the mode of reasoning from resemblance to
  resemblance. When we find on attentive examination resemblances in
  objects apparently diverse, and in which at first no such resemblances
  were discovered, a presumption arises that other resemblances may be
  found by further examination in these or other objects likewise
  apparently diverse. It is on the belief in a unity in nature that all
  inferences from analogy rest. The general inference from analogy is
  always perfectly valid. Wherever there is resemblance, similarity or
  identity of cause somewhere may be justly inferred; but to infer the
  particular cause without particular proof is always to reason falsely.
  Analogy is of great use and constant application in science, in
  philosophy, and in the common business of life.</p>

  <p><b>Anal´ysis</b>, the resolution of an object, whether of the senses
  or the intellect, into its component elements. The word was introduced by
  Boyle in the seventeenth century. In philosophy it is the mode of
  resolving a compound idea into its simple parts, in order to consider
  them more distinctly, and arrive at a more precise knowledge of the
  whole. It is opposed to <i>synthesis</i>, by which we combine and class
  our perceptions, and contrive expressions for our thoughts, so as to
  represent their several divisions, classes, and relations.</p>

  <p>Analysis, in mathematics, is, in the widest sense, the expression and
  development of the functions of quantities by calculation; in a narrower
  sense the resolving of problems by algebraic equations. The analysis of
  the ancients was exhibited only in geometry, and made use only of
  geometrical assistance, whereby it is distinguished from the analysis of
  the moderns, which extends to all measurable objects, and expresses in
  equations the mutual dependence of magnitudes. Analysis is divided into
  lower and higher, the lower comprising, besides arithmetic and algebra,
  the doctrines of functions, of series, combinations, logarithms, and
  curves, the higher comprising the differential and integral calculus, and
  the calculus of variations.</p>

  <p>In chemistry, analysis is the process of decomposing a compound
  substance with a view to determine either (<i>a</i>) what elements it
  contains (<i>qualitative analysis</i>), or (<i>b</i>) how much of each
  element is present (<i>quantitative analysis</i>). Thus by the first
  process we learn that water is a compound of hydrogen and oxygen, and by
  the second that it consists of one part of hydrogen by weight to eight
  parts of oxygen. As a means of testing soils and feeding-stuffs, analysis
  has given important results; it has enabled Liebig to solve the problem
  of plant-nutrition.</p>

  miles, doubtless a great exaggeration. There are still several dagobas in

  <p><b>An´archists</b>, a revolutionary sect or body setting forth as the
  social ideal the extreme form of individual freedom, holding that all
  government is injurious and immoral, and that the destruction of every
  social form now existing must be the first step to the creation of a new
  social system. According to Herbert Spencer, anarchism is the doctrine of
  <i>laisser faire</i>. Anarchists usually look upon Diderot as one of
  their pioneers, and quote his lines: "La nature n'a fait ni serviteurs ni
  maîtres. Je ne veux ni donner ni reçevoir de lois." Historically,
  however, it is Proudhon who may be considered as the father of anarchism.
  The recognition of the anarchists as an independent sect may be dated
  from the secession of Bakunin and his followers from the Social Democrats
  at the congress of the Hague in 1872, since which they have maintained an
  active propaganda. Their principal journals have been <i>La Révolte</i>
  (Paris), the <i>Freiheit</i> (New York), <i>Liberty</i> (Boston), and the
  <i>Anarchist</i> (London). Among modern philosophers of anarchism are
  Elisée Reclus and Prince Kropotkin.</p>

  <p><b>Anarthrop´oda</b>, one of the two great divisions (the Arthropoda

  imperial life-guard, and owed his elevation to Ariadne, widow of Zeno,
  whom he married forty days after the death of her husband. He
  distinguished himself by suppressing the combats between men and wild
  beasts in the arena, abolishing the sale of offices, building the
  fortifications  of Constantinople, &amp;c. His support of the heretical
  Eutychians led to a dangerous rebellion. He died <span

  <p><b>Anastatic Printing</b>, a process by which the perfect facsimile of
  a page of type or an engraving, old or new, can be reproduced and printed
  in the manner of a lithograph. The print or page to be transferred is
  dipped in diluted nitric acid, and, while moist with dilute acid, it is
  laid face downwards on a polished zinc plate and passed through a
  roller-press. The zinc is immediately corroded by the acid contained in
  the paper, excepting on those parts occupied by the ink of the type or
  engraving. The ink, while rejecting the acid, is loosened by it, and
  deposits a thin film on the zinc, thus protecting it from the action of
  the acid. The result is that those parts are left slightly raised in
  relief and greasy. The plate is then treated as in ordinary lithographic
  printing (q.v.).&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: F.&nbsp;H.

  vessels, or the opening of one vessel into another, as an artery into
  another artery, or a vein into a vein. By means of anastomosis, if the
  course of a fluid is arrested in one vessel it can proceed along others.
  It is by anastomosis that circulation is re-established in amputated

  <i>curse</i>. The Roman Catholic Church pronounces the sentence of
  anathema against heretics, schismatics, and all who wilfully pursue a
  course of conduct condemned by the Church. The subject of the anathema is
  declared an outcast from the Church, all the faithful are forbidden to

  <p><b>Anat´omy</b>, in the literal sense, means simply a cutting up, but
  is now generally applied both to the art of dissecting or artificially
  separating the different parts of an organized body (vegetable or animal)
  with a view to discover their situation, structure, and economy; and to
  the science which treats of the internal structure of <!-- Page 154
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page154"></a>[154]</span>organized
  bodies. By means of the dissection of the human body the surgeon and
  physician acquire the knowledge of the geography of the territory in
  which all their professional operations are carried on. <i>Comparative
  anatomy</i> is the science which compares the anatomy of different
  classes or species of animals, as that of man with quadrupeds, or that of
  quadrupeds with fishes. The anatomy of an animal may be studied from
  various standpoints: with relation to the succession of forms which it
  exhibits from its first stage to its adult form (<i>developmental</i> or
  <i>embryotical anatomy</i>); with reference to the general properties and
  structure of the tissues or textures (<i>general anatomy</i>,
  <i>histology</i>); with reference to the changes in structure of organs
  or parts produced by disease and congenital malformations (<i>morbid</i>
  or <i>pathological anatomy</i>); or with reference to the function, use,
  or purpose performed by the organs or parts (<i>teleological</i> or
  <i>physiological anatomy</i>). According to the parts of the body
  described, the different divisions of human anatomy receive different
  names; as, <i>osteology</i>, the description of the bones;
  <i>myology</i>, of the muscles; <i>arthrology</i>, of the ligaments and
  sinews; <i>splanchnology</i>, of the viscera or internal organs, in which
  are reckoned the lungs, stomach, and intestines, the liver, spleen,
  kidneys, bladder, pancreas, &amp;c. <i>Angiology</i> describes the
  vessels through which the liquids in the body are conducted, including
  the blood-vessels, which are divided into arteries and veins, and the
  lymphatic vessels, some of which absorb matters from the bowels, while
  others are distributed through the whole body, collecting juices from the
  tissues and carrying them back into the blood. <i>Neurology</i> describes
  the system of the nerves and of the brain; <i>dermatology</i> treats of
  the skin.&mdash;Among anatomical labours are particularly to be mentioned
  the making and preserving of anatomical preparations. Preparations of
  this sort can be preserved (1) by macerating the body so as to obtain the
  bones of the skeleton; or (2) by treating the body or some part of it
  with alcohol, formalin, or other preservative, which renders its tissues
  imperishable.</p>

  <p>Among the ancient writers or authorities on human anatomy may be
  mentioned Hippocrates the younger (460-377 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>), Aristotle (384-322 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>), Herophilus and Erasistratus of Alexandria
  (about 300 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), Celsus (53 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>-<span class="scac">A.D.</span> 37), and Galen of
  Pergamus (<span class="scac">A.D.</span> 130-200), the most celebrated of
  all the ancient authorities on the science. From his time till the
  revival of learning in Europe in the fourteenth century anatomy was
  checked in its progress. In 1315 Mondino, professor at Bologna, first
  publicly performed dissection, and published a <i>System of Anatomy</i>
  which was a textbook in the schools of Italy for about 200 years. In the
  sixteenth century Fallopio of Padua, Eustachi of Venice, Vesalius of
  Brussels, Varoli of Bologna, and many others, enriched anatomy with new
  discoveries. In the seventeenth century Harvey discovered the circulation
  of the blood, Asellius discovered the manner in which the nutritious part
  of the food is conveyed into the circulation, while the lymphatic system
  was detected and described by the Dane T. Bartoline. Among the renowned
  anatomists of later times we can only mention Malpighi, Boerhaave,
  William and John Hunter, the younger Meckel, Bichat, Rosenmüller, Quain,
  Sir A. Cooper, Sir C. Bell, Carus, Joh. Müller, Gegenbaur, Owen, and
  Huxley.</p>

  <p>Until 1832 the law of Great Britain made very insufficient provision
  for enabling anatomists to obtain the necessary supply of subjects for
  dissection. An Act of some years previously had, it is true, empowered a
  criminal court, when it saw fit, to give up to properly-qualified persons
  the body of a murderer after execution for dissection. This, however, was
  far from supplying the deficiency, and many persons, tempted by the high
  prices offered for bodies by anatomists, resorted to the nefarious
  practice of digging up newly-buried corpses, and frequently, as in the
  case of the notorious Burke and Hare of Edinburgh, to murder. To remedy
  these evils a statute was passed in 1832, which was intended to make
  provision for the wants of surgeons, students, or other duly-qualified
  persons, by permitting, under certain regulations, the dissection of the
  bodies of persons who die friendless in alms-houses, hospitals, &amp;c.
  The Act also appointed inspectors of anatomy, regulated the anatomical
  schools, and required persons practising the operations to obtain a
  licence. Relatives may effectually object to the anatomical examination
  of a body even though the deceased had expressed a desire for
  it.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: D.&nbsp;J. Cunningham,

  <p><b>Anaxag´oras</b>, an ancient Greek philosopher of the Ionic school,
  born at Clazomenæ, in Ionia, probably about 500 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> When only about twenty years of age he settled
  at Athens, and soon gained a high reputation, and gathered round him a
  circle of renowned pupils, including Pericles, Euripides, Socrates,
  &amp;c. At the age of fifty he was publicly charged with impiety and
  condemned to death, but the sentence was commuted to perpetual
  banishment. He thereupon went to Lampsacus, where he died about 428.
  Anaxagoras belonged to the atomic school of Ionic philosophers. He held
  that there was an infinite number of different kinds of elementary atoms,
  and that these, in themselves motionless and originally existing in a
  state of <!-- Page 155 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page155"></a>[155]</span>chaos, were put in motion by an eternal,
  immaterial, spiritual, elementary being, <i>Nous</i> (Intelligence), from
  which motion the world was produced. His conception of <i>Nous</i> as the
  first cause of movement marks a great advance in the history of
  philosophical thought, for he thus placed spirit above matter. The stars
  were, according to him, of earthy materials; the sun a glowing mass,
  about as large as the Peloponnesus; the earth was flat; the moon a dark,
  inhabitable body, receiving its light from the sun; the comets wandering
  stars.</p>

  <p><b>Anaximan´der,</b> an ancient Greek (Ionic) philosopher, was born at
  Miletus in 611 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, and died 547. The
  fundamental principle of his philosophy is that the source of all things
  is an undefined substance infinite in quantity. The firmament is composed
  of heat and cold, the stars of air and fire. The sun occupies the highest
  place in the heavens, has a circumference twenty-eight times larger than
  the earth, and resembles a cylinder, from which streams of fire issue.
  The moon is likewise a cylinder, nineteen times larger than the earth.
  The earth has the shape of a cylinder, and is placed in the midst of the
  universe, where it remains suspended. His philosophy is thus a step in
  advance of the theories of Thales, the conception of the Infinite,
  however vague, being superior to the idea of water constituting the first
  principle of all things. Anaximander occupied himself a great deal with
  mathematics and geography. To him is credited the invention of
  geographical maps and the first application of the <i>gnomon</i> or style
  fixed on a horizontal plane to determine the solstices and equinoxes.</p>

  <p><b>Anaximenes</b> (an-aks-im´e-n&#x113;z) <b>of Miletus</b>, an
  ancient Greek (Ionic) philosopher, according to whom air was the first
  principle of all things. Finite things were formed from the infinite air
  by compression and rarefaction produced by eternally existent motion; and
  heat and cold resulted from varying degrees of density of the primal
  element. He flourished about 550 B.C.</p>

  <p><b>Anbury</b> (an´be-ri) (called also <b>Club-root</b> and <b>Fingers
  and Toes</b>), a disease in turnips, in which knobs or excrescences are
  formed on the root, which is then useless for feeding purposes. Some
  authorities distinguish anbury proper from 'fingers and toes' in turnips,
  setting it down as a distinct disease due to a fungus, while in the other
  case the roots simply assume a bad habit of growth through some unknown
  influence.</p>

  Andes and the Pacific; area, 16,562 sq. miles. Capital Hararaz. Pop.

  <p><b>Ancestor-worship,</b> an ancient and widespread practice, displayed
  in its most characteristic form in modern China and ancient Rome, which
  apparently was based upon the belief that dead parents or ancestors,
  represented by images or 'ancestral tablets', could be revived by
  appropriate ceremonies, such as burning incense or offering libations,
  and give the benefit of their wisdom to their descendants who performed
  the vitalizing ritual and asked for their advice upon, or their sanction
  for, actions affecting the welfare of the family. The earliest deity was
  a dead king (Osiris), whose advice was sought by his son and successor.
  Hence in primitive religions, in which an endless variety of
  modifications of these more ancient beliefs has arisen, ancestor-worship
  may take the form of pious devotion to an actual ancestor or to a
  supernatural deity. As many of the most ancient gods were identified with
  animals, the dead ancestor, or his soul, is believed by many peoples to
  become incarnate in the appropriate animal, which is accorded the special
  veneration of a god or supernatural adviser, and set apart as sacred.
  Ancestor-worship still survives in a great variety of forms among various
  peoples.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: E.&nbsp;B. Tylor,

  <p><b>Anchises</b> (an-k&#x12B;´s&#x113;z), the father of the Trojan hero
  Æneas, who carried him off on his shoulders at the burning of Troy and
  made him the companion of his voyage to Italy. This voyage, which is not
  mentioned in the Homeric legend, is described by Virgil in his
  <i>Æneid</i>. He died at Drepanum, in Sicily.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b>An´chor,</b> an implement for holding a ship or other vessel at
  rest in the water. In ancient times large stones or crooked pieces of
  wood heavily weighted with metal were used for this purpose. The anchor
  now used is of iron, formed with a strong <i>shank</i>, at one extremity
  of which is the <i>crown</i>, from which branch out two <i>arms</i>,
  terminating in broad <i>palms</i> or <i>flukes</i>, the sharp extremity
  of which is the <i>peak</i> or <i>bill</i>; at the other end of the shank
  is the <i>stock</i> (fixed at right angles to the plane of the arms),
  behind which is the <i>ring</i>, to which a cable can be attached. The
  principal use of the stock is to <!-- Page 156 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page156"></a>[156]</span>cause the arms to fall
  so as one of the flukes shall enter the ground. Many anchors are made
  nowadays without a stock. The anchors of the largest size carried by
  men-of-war are the <i>best</i> and <i>small bowers</i>, the <i>sheet</i>,
  and the <i>spare</i>, to which are added the <i>stream</i> and the
  <i>kedge</i>, which are used for anchoring in a stream or other sheltered
  place and for warping the vessel from one place to another. Many
  improvements and novelties in the shape and construction of anchors have
  been introduced within recent times. The principal names connected with
  those alterations are those of Lieutenant Rodgers, who introduced the
  <i>hollow-shanked anchor</i> with the view of increasing the strength
  without adding to the weight; Porter, who made the arms and flukes
  movable by pivoting them to the stock instead of fixing them immovably,
  causing the anchor to take a readier and firmer hold, and avoiding the
  chance of the cable becoming foul; Trotman, who further improved on
  Porter's invention; and M. Martin, whose anchor is of very peculiar form,
  and is constructed so as to be self-canting, the arms revolving through
  an angle of 30° either way, and the sharp points of the flukes being
  always ready to enter the ground.</p>

  <p><b>An´chorites</b>, or <b>An´chorets</b> (Gr.
  <i>anachor&#x113;tai</i>, persons who have withdrawn themselves from the
  world), in the early Church a class of religious persons who generally
  passed their lives in cells, from which they never removed. Their
  habitations were, in many instances, entirely separated from the abodes
  of other men, sometimes in the depth of wildernesses, in pits or caverns;
  at other times several of these individuals fixed their habitations in
  the vicinity of each other, but they always lived personally separate.
  The continual prevalence of fierce wars, civil commotions, and
  persecutions at the beginning of the Christian era must have made
  retirement and religious meditation agreeable to men of quiet and
  contemplative minds. This spirit, however, soon led to fanatical
  excesses; many anchorites went without proper clothing, wore heavy
  chains, and we find at the close of the fourth century Simeon Stylites
  passing thirty years on the top of a column without ever descending from
  it, and finally dying there. In Egypt and Syria, where Christianity
  became blended with the Grecian philosophy and strongly tinged with the
  peculiar notions of the East, the anchorites were most numerous; in
  Europe there were comparatively few, and on the development and
  establishment of the monastic system they completely disappeared. See

  <p><b>Anchovy</b> (an-ch&#x14D;´vi), a small fish of the Herring family,
  all the species, with exception of the common anchovy (<i>Engraulis

  species), inhabitants of the tropical seas of India and America. The
  common anchovy, so esteemed for its rich and peculiar flavour, is not
  much larger than the middle finger. It is caught in vast numbers in the
  Mediterranean, and frequently on the coasts of France, Holland, and the
  south of England, and pickled for exportation. A favourite sauce is made
  by pounding the pickled fish in water, simmering for a short time, adding
  a little cayenne pepper, and straining the whole through a
  hair-sieve.</p>

  Rome, with harbour works begun by Trajan, who built the ancient mole or
  quay. A triumphal arch of white marble, erected in honour of Trajan,
  stands on the mole. Ancona is a station of the Italian fleet, and the
  commerce is increasing. The town is indifferently built, but has some
  remarkable edifices, among others, the cathedral. There is a colossal
  statue of Count Cavour. Ancona is said to have been founded about four
  centuries <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, by Syracusan refugees. It fell
  into the hands of the Romans in the first half of the third century <span

  Médici to Henri IV, in 1600, came in her suite to France, where he
  obtained rapid promotion, more especially after the assassination of the
  king (1610). He became successively Governor of Normandy, Marshal of
  France, and last of all, Prime Minister. Being thoroughly detested by all
  classes, at last a conspiracy was formed against him, and he was shot
  dead on the bridge of the Louvre in 1617.</p>

  <p><b>Ancre, Battle of.</b> This battle was the final one in the British
  offensive in France in 1916. It began on 13th Nov. after a two day's
  preliminary bombardment of the German salient, on both sides of the River
  Ancre, from Beaumont-Hamel to St. Pierre Divion. One area of
  extraordinary strength was the Y ravine which stretches from
  Beaumont-Hamel plateau towards the river. The assaults on both banks of
  the river were vigorous and determined. A fierce struggle was waged in
  the Y ravine, which Scottish troops ultimately cleared with the bayonet.
  Beaumont-Hamel having fallen, the British line was extended well beyond
  it. Further gains were made on the following day. The prisoners captured
  numbered 7200. This brilliant action paved the way for further successes
  in the spring.</p>

  its whole extent by ranges of mountains, the loftiest being the Sierra
  Nevada, many summits of which are covered with perpetual snow (Mulahacen
  is 11,678 feet). Minerals abound, and several mines have been opened by
  English companies, especially in the province of Huelva, where the
  Tharsis and Rio Tinto copper-mines are situated. The principal river is
  the Guadalquivir. The vine, myrtle, olive, palm, banana, carob, &amp;c.,
  grow abundantly in the valley of the Guadalquivir. Wheat, maize, barley,
  and many varieties of fruit grow almost spontaneously; besides which,
  honey, silk, and cochineal form important articles of culture. The horses
  and mules are the best in the Peninsula; the bulls are sought for
  bull-fighting over all Spain; sheep are reared in vast numbers.

  <p><b>An´dersen</b>, Hans Christian, a Danish novelist, poet, and writer
  of fairy tales, was born of poor parents at Odense, 2nd April, 1805. He
  learned to read and write in a charity school, from which he was taken
  when only nine years old, and was put to work in a manufactory in order
  that his earnings might assist his widowed mother. In his leisure time he
  eagerly read national ballads, poetry, and plays, and wrote several
  tragedies full of sound and fury. In 1819 he went to Copenhagen, but
  failed in getting any of his plays accepted, and in securing an
  appointment at the theatre, having to content himself for some time with
  unsteady employment as a joiner. His abilities at last brought him under
  the notice of Councillor Collin, a man of considerable influence, who
  procured for him free entrance into a Government school at Slagelse. From
  this school he was transferred to the university, and soon became
  favourably known by his poetic works. Through the influence of
  Oehlenschläger and Ingermann he received a royal grant to enable him to
  travel, and in 1833 he visited Italy, his impressions of which he
  published in <i>The Improvvisatore</i> (1835)&mdash;a work which rendered
  his fame European. The scene of his following novel, <i>O.&nbsp;T.</i>, was
  laid in Denmark, and in <i>Only a Fiddler</i> he described his own early
  struggles. In 1835 appeared the first volume of his <i>Fairy Tales</i>,
  of which successive volumes continued to be published year by year at
  Christmas, and which have been the most popular and widespread of his
  works. Among his other works are <i>Picture-books without
  Pictures</i>&mdash;conversations of the author with the moon, who came to
  visit the poet in his garret; <i>A Poet's Bazaar</i>&mdash;the result of
  a voyage in 1840 to the East; and a number of dramas. In 1845 he received
  an annuity from the Government. He visited England in 1848, and acquired
  such a command of the language that his next work, <i>The Two
  Baronesses</i>, was written in English. In 1855 he published an
  autobiography, under the title <i>My Life's Romance</i>, an English
  translation of which, published in 1871, contained additional chapters by
  the author, bringing the narrative to 1867. Among his later works we may
  mention, <i>To Be or Not To Be</i> (1857); <i>Tales from Jutland</i>
  (1859); <i>The Ice Maiden</i> (1863). He died 4th Aug, 1875, having had
  the pleasure of seeing many of his works translated into most of the
  European languages.</p>

  <p><b>Anderson</b>, Elizabeth Garrett, <span class="scac">M.D.</span>,
  born in 1836, maiden name Garrett, married Mr. J.&nbsp;S. Anderson of the
  Orient Line of steamers. She studied medicine, but met with many
  obstacles, the study of medicine by women being then discouraged on all
  hands; at last she was licensed to practise by the Apothecaries' Society
  in 1865, and afterwards passed examinations at the University of Paris
  and obtained the degree of Doctor of Medicine. From 1866 to 1890 she was
  senior physician to the New Hospital for Women; from 1876 to 1898
  lecturer on medicine in the London School of Medicine for Women. She did
  much to aid in opening the medical profession to women. In 1908 she was
  elected Mayor of Aldeburgh, being the first woman to hold the position of
  mayor in England. She died on 17th Dec., 1917. Her daughter Louisa
  Garrett Anderson, born in 1873, went to France in 1914 as Joint Organiser
  of and Chief Surgeon to the Women's Hospital Corps, Voluntary Unit.</p>

  <p><b>Anderson</b>, James, a Scottish writer on political and rural
  economy, born at Hermiston in 1739, died in 1808. In 1790 he started the
  <i>Bee</i>, which ran to eighteen volumes, and contains many useful
  papers on agricultural, economical, and other topics. Some of his other
  publications, <!-- Page 159 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p><b>Anderson</b>, John, <span class="scac">F.R.S.</span>, professor of
  natural philosophy in the University of Glasgow, born 1726, died 1796. By
  his will he directed that the whole of his effects should be devoted to
  the establishment of an educational institution in Glasgow, to be
  denominated <i>Anderson's University</i>, for the use of the unacademical
  classes. According to the design of the founder, there were to be four
  colleges&mdash;for arts, medicine, law, and theology&mdash;besides an
  initiatory school. As the funds, however, were totally inadequate to the
  plan, it was at first commenced with only a single course of lectures on
  natural philosophy and chemistry. The institution gradually enlarged its
  sphere of instruction, coming nearer and nearer to the original design of
  its founder, the medical school in particular possessing a high
  reputation. In 1886 it was incorporated with other institutions to form
  the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College (now Glasgow Royal
  Technical College), Anderson's College medical school, however, retaining
  a distinct position.</p>

  <p><b>Anderson</b>, Joseph, Scottish antiquary, born in 1832, became a
  school teacher, was for some years newspaper editor, and in 1870 was
  appointed keeper of the National Museum of Antiquities, Edinburgh. His
  chief works embody the lectures delivered by him as Rhind lecturer in
  archæology to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland: <i>Scotland in
  Early Christian Times</i>, <i>Scotland in Pagan Times</i>, and the
  <i>Early Christian Monuments of Scotland</i>. He also edited <i>The

  <p><b>Andes</b> (an´d&#x113;z), or, as they are called in Spanish South
  America, <b>Cordilleras</b> (ridges) <b>de los Andes</b>, or simply
  <b>Cordilleras</b>, a range of mountains stretching along the whole of
  the west coast of South America, from Cape Horn to the Isthmus of Panama
  and the Caribbean Sea. In absolute length (4500 miles) no single chain of
  mountains approaches the Andes, and only a certain number of the higher
  peaks of the Himalayan chain rise higher above the sea-level; which peak
  is the highest of all is not yet settled. Several main sections of this
  huge chain are distinguishable. The Southern Andes present a lofty main
  chain, with a minor chain running parallel to it on the east, reaching
  from Tierra del Fuego and the Straits of Magellan, northward to about
  lat. 28° <span class="scac">S.</span>, and rising in Aconcagua to a
  height of 23,080 feet. North of this is the double chain of the Central
  Andes, enclosing the wide and lofty plateaus of Bolivia and Peru, which
  lie at an elevation of more than 12,000 feet above the sea. The mountain
  system is here at its broadest, being about 500 miles across. Here are
  also several very lofty peaks, as Illampu or Sorata (21,484 feet), Sahama
  (21,054 feet), Illimani (21,024 feet). Farther north the outer and inner
  ranges draw closer together, and in Ecuador there is but a single system
  of elevated masses, generally described as forming two parallel chains.
  In this section are crowded together a number of lofty peaks, most of
  them volcanoes, either extinct or active. Of the latter class are
  Pichincha (15,918 feet), with a crater 2500 feet deep; Tunguragua (16,685
  feet); Sangay (17,460 feet); and Cotopaxi (19,550 feet). The loftiest
  summit here appears to be Chimborazo (20,581 feet); others are Antisana
  (19,260 feet) and Cayambe (19,200 feet). Northward of this section the
  Andes break into three distinct ranges, the east-most running
  north-eastward into Venezuela, the westmost running north-westward to the
  Isthmus of Panama. In the central range is the volcano of Tolima (17,660
  feet). The western slope of the Andes is generally exceedingly steep, the
  eastern much less so, the mountains sinking gradually to the plains. The
  whole range gives evidence of volcanic action, but it consists almost
  entirely of sedimentary rocks. Thus mountains may be found rising to the
  height of over 20,000 feet, and fossiliferous to their summits (as
  Illimani and Sorata or Illampu). There are about thirty volcanoes in a
  state of activity. The loftiest of these burning mountains seems to be
  Gualateïri, in Peru (21,960 feet). The heights of the others vary from
  13,000 to 20,000 feet. All the districts of the Andes system have
  suffered severely from earthquakes, towns having been either destroyed or
  greatly injured by these visitations. Peaks crowned with perpetual snow
  are seen all along the range, and glaciers are also met with, more
  especially from Aconcagua southwards. The passes are generally at a great
  height, the most important being from 10,000 to 15,000 feet. Railways
  have been constructed to cross the chain at a similar elevation. The
  Andes are extremely rich in the precious metals, gold, silver, copper,
  platinum, mercury, and tin all being wrought; lead and iron are also
  found. The llama and kindred species&mdash;the guanaco, vicuña, <!-- Page
  160 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page160"></a>[160]</span>and
  alpaca&mdash;are characteristic of the Andes. Among birds, the condor is
  the most remarkable. The vegetation necessarily varies much according to
  elevation, latitude, rainfall, &amp;c., but generally is rich and varied.
  Except in the south and north little rain falls on the western side of
  the range, and in the centre there is a considerable desert area. On the
  east side the rainfall is heavy in the equatorial regions, but in the
  south is very scanty or altogether deficient. From the Andes rise two of
  the largest water systems of the world&mdash;the Amazon and its
  affluents, and the La Plata and its affluents. Besides which, in the
  north, from its slopes flow the Magdalena to the Caribbean Sea, and some
  tributaries to the Orinoco. The mountain chain pressing so close upon the
  Pacific Ocean, no streams of importance flow from its western slopes. The
  number of lakes is not great; the largest and most important is that of
  Titicaca on the Bolivian plateau. In the Andes are towns at a greater
  elevation than anywhere else in the world, the highest being the
  silver-mining town of Cerro de Pasco (14,270 feet), the next being
  Potosi.</p>

  <p><b>An´desin</b>, a kind of felspar containing both soda and lime, and
  named from being first obtained in the Andes.</p>

  <p><b>An´desite</b>, a name given to a crystalline volcanic rock or group
  of rocks of very wide occurrence, consisting mostly of felspar mixed with
  other ingredients, especially hornblende and augite, often also
  hypersthene and mica, the four chief varieties being named accordingly.
  Andesite is often porphyritic in character, with large crystals of
  felspar scattered through it. These rocks are commonly eruptive products
  of volcanoes of the tertiary or more recent periods, and the name was
  given by C.&nbsp;L. von Buch on account of their prevalence in the lavas of
  volcanoes of the Andes. The Ochils and other hills of middle Scotland
  largely consist of andesite.</p>

  years, is governed by its own civil and criminal codes, and has its own
  courts of justice, the laws being administered by two judges, one of whom
  is chosen by France, the other by the Bishop of Urgel, in Spain. The
  little State pays an annual due of 960 francs to France, and 460 pesetas
  to the Bishop of Urgel. The chief industry is the rearing of sheep and

  several of them of an amusing and satirical character. He was long
  believed to be the founder of the celebrated Rosicrucian order, an
  opinion that received a certain support from some of his works, but in

  <p><b>Andreev</b>, Leonid Nicolaievitsh, Russian author, born in 1871,
  died in 1919. He studied law at the Universities of Moscow and Petrograd,
  but finding his practice unremunerative he became a police-court reporter
  for a daily paper. At the age of twenty-three he attempted suicide,
  driven to it by his miserable circumstances and struggle for existence.
  His first story, <i>About a Poor Student</i>, based upon his own
  experiences, attracted but little attention, and his literary career
  really began when Gorky discovered his talent. He was one of the most
  prolific Russian writers, the short story being his speciality. He was a
  mystic and a fatalist, like so many of his compatriots. His works
  include: <i>The Red Laugh</i> (1905); <i>The Seven who were Hanged</i>
  (1909); <i>Judas Iscariot and the Others</i> (1910); <i>A Dilemma</i>
  (1910); <i>Silence and Other Stories</i>, &amp;c. His works have been
  translated into many European languages.</p>

  <p><b>Andrew, St.</b>, brother of St. Peter, and the first disciple whom
  Christ chose. He is said to have preached in Scythia, in Thrace and Asia
  Minor, and in Achaia (Greece), and according to tradition he was
  crucified by order of the Roman governor Ægeas at Patræ, now Patras, in
  Achaia, on a cross of the form <a href="images/cross.png"><img
  src="images/cross.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="X" /></a>
  (decussate cross), now known as a St. Andrew's cross. The Russians revere
  him as the apostle who brought the gospel to them; the Scots, as the
  patron saint of their country. The day dedicated to him is 30th Nov. The
  Russian order of St. Andrew was instituted by Peter the Great in 1698.

  in favour both with Queen Elizabeth and James I. In 1605 he became Bishop
  of Chichester; in 1609 was translated to Ely, and appointed one of the
  king's privy-councillors; and in 1618 he was translated to Winchester. He
  was one of those engaged in preparing the authorized version of the
  Scriptures. He left sermons, lectures, and other writings.</p>

  <p><b>An´drews, St.</b>, an ancient city and parliamentary burgh in
  Fifeshire, Scotland, 31 miles north-east from Edinburgh; was erected into
  a royal burgh by David I in 1140, and after having been an episcopal,
  became an archiepiscopal see in 1472, and was for long the ecclesiastical
  capital of Scotland. The cathedral, now in ruins, was begun about 1160,
  and took 157 years to finish. The old castle, founded about 1200, and
  rebuilt in the fourteenth century, is also an almost shapeless ruin. In
  it James III was born and Cardinal Beaton assassinated, and in front of
  it George Wishart was burned. There are several other interesting ruins.
  The trade and manufactures are of no importance, but the town is in
  favour as a watering-place. Golf is much played here. Pop.
  7597.&mdash;The <i>University of St. Andrews</i>, the oldest of the
  Scottish universities, founded in 1411, consists of the united colleges
  of St. Salvator and St. Leonard and the college of St. Mary, both at St.
  Andrews, and embraces also University College, Dundee. In 1579 the
  colleges of St. Salvator and St. Leonard were restricted to the teaching
  of arts and medicine, and that of St. Mary to theology. In 1747 the two
  former colleges were united by Act of Parliament. University College,
  Dundee, was founded in 1880. The united college of St. Salvator and St.
  Leonard has a principal (who is also principal of the university) and
  twelve professors, and the college of St. Mary has a principal and four
  professors. Degrees, open to women as well as men, are conferred in arts,
  divinity, science, medicine, and law; and the university also confers the
  diploma and title of <span class="scac">L.L.A.</span> (Lady Literate in
  Arts). The number of students is 420. In connection with the university
  is a library, founded in 1612 and containing about 150,000 printed
  volumes and 150 MSS. The university unites with the other three Scottish
  universities in returning three members to Parliament. Madras College or
  Academy, founded by Dr. Bell of Madras, the principal secondary school of
  the place, provides accommodation for upwards of 1500 scholars.</p>

  <p><b>An´drews</b>, Thomas, chemist, was born at Belfast in 1813; studied
  chemistry at Glasgow under Thomas Thomson, and for a short time in Paris;
  then medicine at Belfast, Dublin, and Edinburgh, taking the degree of
  <span class="scac">M.D.</span> at the last place. After practising and
  teaching chemistry for ten years in Belfast, he became vice-president of
  the Northern College there, which in 1849 was converted into Queen's
  College, and Andrews now became professor of chemistry in the college, a
  post which he held till 1879. He died in 1885, having received various
  academic distinctions in <!-- Page 162 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page162"></a>[162]</span>the course of his life. His name is
  associated with valuable researches on the heat of chemical combustion,
  and on the nature of ozone, but especially with the discovery of the
  existence of a critical temperature for every gas, above which it cannot
  be liquefied by any pressure, however great. He wrote many scientific
  papers, which have been published in a collective form by P.&nbsp;G. Tait and
  A. Crum Brown.</p>

  beauty, the offended goddesses prevailed on their father, Poseid&#x14D;n
  (Neptune), to afflict the country with a horrid sea-monster, which
  threatened universal destruction. To appease the offended god, Andromeda
  was chained to a rock, but was rescued by Perseus; and after death was
  changed into a constellation. The legend forms the subject of tragedies

  </div>

  <p><b>Anemom´eter</b> (Gr. <i>an&#x115;mos</i>, wind, <i>metron</i>,
  measure), an instrument for measuring the force and velocity of the wind.
  This force is usually measured by the pressure of the wind upon a square
  plate attached to one end of a spiral spring (with its axis horizontal),
  which yields more or less according to the force of the wind, and
  transmits its motion to a pencil which leaves a trace upon paper moved by
  clockwork. Various instruments have been devised for this purpose, but
  the one most commonly adopted by <!-- Page 163 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page163"></a>[163]</span>meteorological stations
  is after the type invented by Dr. Robinson of Armagh. It consists of four
  hemispherical cups <span class="scac">A</span> attached to the ends of
  equal horizontal arms, forming a horizontal cross which turns freely
  about a vertical axis <span class="scac">B</span>. By means of an endless
  screw carried by the axis a train of wheelwork is set in motion; and the
  indication is given by a hand which moves round a dial; or in some
  instruments by several hands moving round different dials like those of a
  gas-meter. It is found that the centre of each cup moves with a velocity
  which is almost exactly one-third of that of the wind. There are various
  other forms of the instrument, one of which is portable, and is
  especially intended for measuring the velocity of currents of air passing
  through mines, and the ventilating spaces of hospitals and other public
  buildings. The direction of the wind as indicated by a vane can also be
  made to leave a continuous record by various contrivances; one of the
  most common being a pinion carried by the shaft of a vane, and driving a
  rack which carries a pencil.</p>

  <p><b>Anem´&#x14F;n&#x113;</b> (Gr. <i>an&#x115;mos</i>, wind),
  wind-flower, a genus of plants belonging to the Buttercup family
  (Ranunculaceæ), containing about ninety species, found in temperate
  regions, three of them occurring in Britain: the white-flowered (<i>A.
  nemor&#x14D;sa</i>), the only one truly native; the blue-flowered (<i>A.
  apenn&#x12B;na</i>); and the yellow-flowered (<i>A. ranunculoides</i>), a
  common European species naturalized in some parts of Britain. Several
  species are cultivated as florists' flowers.</p>

  <p><b>Anemoph´ilous</b>, said of flowers that are fertilized by the wind
  conveying the pollen.</p>

  <p><b>Anem´oscope</b>, any contrivance indicating the direction of the
  wind; generally applied to a vane which turns a spindle descending
  through the roof to a chamber where, by means of a compass-card and
  index, the direction of the wind is shown.</p>

  Saxons at the battle of Cattraeth. See <i>Celtic Literature</i>.</p>

  <p><b>An´eurism</b>, or <b>Aneurysm</b> (Gr. <i>aneurysma</i>, a
  widening), the dilatation or expansion of some part of an artery.
  Aneurisms arise partly from the too violent motion of the blood, and
  partly from degenerative changes occurring in the coats of the artery,
  diminishing their elasticity. They are therefore more frequent in the
  great branches; in particular, in the vicinity of the heart, in the arch
  of the aorta, and in the extremities, where the arteries are exposed to
  frequent injuries by stretching, violent bodily exertions, thrusts,
  falls, and contusions. An internal aneurism may burst and cause
  death.</p>

  <p><b>Angara´</b>, a Siberian river which flows into Lake Baikal at its
  <span class="scac">N.</span> extremity, and leaves it near the <span

  Upper Tunguska.</p>

  <p><b>Angel</b> (Gr. <i>angelos</i>, a messenger), one of those spiritual
  intelligences who are regarded as dwelling in Heaven and employed as the
  ministers or agents of God. To these the name of good angels is sometimes
  given, to distinguish them from bad angels, who were originally created
  to occupy the same blissful abode, but lost it by rebellion. The Old
  Testament represents them as messengers of the Divine will, and Christ
  spoke of them more than once (<i>St. Matt.</i> xviii, 10; <i>St.
  Luke</i>, xv, 10). Generally, however, Scripture speaks of angels with
  great reserve, Michael and Gabriel alone being mentioned by name in the
  canonical books, while Raphael is mentioned in the Apocrypha. The angels
  are represented in Scripture as in the most elevated state of
  intelligence, purity, and bliss, ever doing the will of God so perfectly
  that we can seek for nothing higher or better than to aim at being like
  them. There are indications of a diversity of rank and power among them,
  and something like angelic orders&mdash;Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel,
  &amp;c., seraphim and cherubim. They are represented as frequently taking
  part in communications made from heaven to earth, as directly and
  actively ministering to the good of believers, and shielding or
  delivering them from evils incident to their earthly lot. That every
  person has a <!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page164"></a>[164]</span>good and a bad angel attendant on him was
  an early belief, and is held to some extent yet. Roman Catholics, since
  St. Ambrosius, who died in 397, show a certain veneration or worship to
  angels, and beg their prayers and their kind offices. The New Testament,
  however, formally forbidding such veneration (<i>Col.</i> ii, 18,
  &amp;c.), Protestants consider this unlawful.</p>

  <p><b>Angel</b>, a gold coin introduced into England in the reign of
  Edward IV, and coined down to the Commonwealth, so named from having the
  representation of the archangel Michael piercing a dragon upon it. It had
  different values in different reigns, varying from 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>

  <p><b>Angel-fish</b>, a fish, <i>Squat&#x12B;na ang&#x115;lus</i>, nearly
  allied to the sharks, very ugly and voracious, preying on other fish. It
  is from 6 to 8 feet long, and takes its name from its pectoral fins,
  which are very large, extending horizontally like wings when spread. This
  fish connects the rays with the sharks, but it differs from both in
  having its mouth placed at the extremity of the head. It is common on the
  south coasts of Britain, and is also called <i>Monk-fish</i> and
  <i>Fiddle-fish</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Angel´ica</b>, a genus of umbelliferous plants, one of which, <i>A.
  sylvestris</i>, a tall plant bearing large umbels of white flowers tinged
  with pink, is common in wet places in Britain, and was formerly believed
  to possess <i>angelic</i> properties as an antidote to poison, a specific
  against witchcraft, &amp;c. The name is also given to an allied plant,
  the <i>Archangelica officin&#x101;lis</i>, found on the banks of rivers
  and ditches in the north of Europe, once generally cultivated as an
  esculent, and still valued for its medicinal properties. It has a large
  fleshy aromatic root, and a strong-furrowed branched stem as high as a
  man. It is cultivated for its agreeable aromatic odour and carminative
  properties. Its blanched stems, candied with sugar, form a very agreeable
  sweetmeat, possessing tonic and stomachic qualities.</p>

  <p><b>Angelico</b> (a<span class="x1"><span

  appellation of <i>Fra Giovanni da Fiesole</i>, one of the most celebrated
  of the early Italian painters. Born 1387, he entered the Dominican order
  in 1407, and was employed by Cosmo de' Medici in painting the monastery
  of St. Mark and the church of St. Annunziata with frescoes. These
  pictures gained him so much celebrity that Pope Nicholas V invited him to
  Rome to ornament his private chapel in the Vatican, and offered him the
  archbishopric of Florence, which Angelico declined. He died at, Rome
  1455. He has been called the 'painter of seraphic dreams'. His works were
  considered unrivalled in finish and in sweetness and harmony of colour,
  and were made the models for religious painters of his own and succeeding
  generations.</p>

  faintness, and apprehension of approaching death: seldom experienced by
  any but those with organic heart-disease. The disease rarely occurs
  before middle age, and is more frequent in men than in women. Those
  liable to attack must lead a quiet, temperate life, avoiding all scenes
  which would unduly rouse their emotions. The first attack is occasionally
  fatal, but usually death occurs as the result of repeated seizures. The
  paroxysm may be relieved by opiates, or the inhalation, under due
  precaution, of anæsthetic vapours.</p>

  <p><b>Angiosperm</b> (an´ji-o-sp&#x117;rm), a term for any plant which

  <p><b>Angle</b>, the point where two lines meet, or the meeting of two
  lines in a point. A <i>plane rectilineal angle</i> is formed by two
  straight lines which meet one another, but are not in the same straight
  line; it may be considered the degree of opening or divergence of the two
  straight lines which thus meet one another. A <i>right angle</i> is an
  angle formed by a straight line falling on another perpendicularly, or an
  angle which is measured by an arc of 90 degrees. When a straight line, as
  <span class="scac">A B</span> (fig. 1), standing on another straight line
  <span class="scac">C D</span>, makes the two angles <span class="scac">A
  B C</span> and <span class="scac">A B D</span> equal to one another, each
  of these angles is called a <i>right angle</i>. An <i>acute angle</i> is
  that which is less than a right angle, as <span class="scac">E B
  C</span>. An <i>obtuse angle</i> is that which is greater than a right
  angle, as <span class="scac">E B D</span>. Acute and obtuse angles are
  both called <i>oblique</i>, in opposition to right angles.
  <i>Exterior</i> or <i>external angles</i>, the angles of any rectilineal
  figure without it, made by producing the sides; thus, if the sides <span
  class="scac">A B</span>, <span class="scac">B C</span>, <span
  class="scac">C A</span> of the triangle <span class="scac">A B C</span>

  angles <span class="scac">C B F</span>, <span class="scac">A C D</span>,
  <span class="scac">B A E</span> are called <i>exterior</i> or <i>external
  angles</i>. A <i>solid angle</i> is that which is made by more than two
  plane angles meeting in one point and not lying in the same plane, as the
  angle of a cube. A <i>spherical angle</i> is an angle on the surface of a
  sphere, contained between the arcs of two great circles which intersect
  each other.</p>

  <p><b>Angler</b> (<i>Lophius piscatorius</i>), also from its habits and
  appearance called <b>Fishing-frog</b> and <b>Sea-devil</b>, a remarkable
  fish often found on the British coasts. It is from 3 to 5 feet long; the
  head is very wide, depressed, with protuberances, and bearing long
  separate movable tendrils; the mouth is capacious, and armed with
  formidable teeth. Its voracity is extreme, and it is said to lie
  concealed in the mud, and attract the smaller fishes within its reach by
  gently waving the filamentous appendages on its head.</p>

  <p><b>Angles</b>, a Low German tribe who in the earliest historical
  period had their seats in the district about Angeln, in the duchy of
  Schleswig, and who in the fifth century and subsequently crossed over to
  Britain along with bands of Saxons and Jutes (and probably Frisians
  also), and colonized a great part of what from them has received the name
  of England, as well as a portion of the Lowlands of Scotland. The Angles
  formed the largest body among the Germanic settlers in Britain, and
  founded the three kingdoms of East Anglia, Mercia, and Northumbria.</p>

  <p><b>Anglesey</b> (ang´gl-s&#x113;), or <b>Anglesea</b> ('the Angles'
  Island'), an island and county of North Wales, in the Irish Sea,
  separated from the mainland by the Menai Strait; 20 miles long and 17
  miles broad; area, 176,630 acres. The surface is comparatively flat, and
  the climate is milder than that of the adjoining coast. The chief
  agricultural products are oats and barley, wheat, rye, potatoes, and
  turnips. Numbers of cattle and sheep are raised. Anglesey yields a little
  copper, lead, silver, ochre, &amp;c. The Menai Strait is crossed by a
  magnificent suspension-bridge, 580 feet between the piers and 100 feet
  above high-water mark, and also by the great Britannia Tubular Railway
  Bridge. The chief market-towns are Beaumaris, Holyhead, Llangefni, and
  Amlweh. The county returns one member to Parliament. Pop. (1921),
  51,695.</p>

  <p><b>Anglesey</b>, Henry William Paget, Marquess of, English soldier and
  statesman, was the eldest son of Henry, first Earl of Uxbridge, and was
  born in 1768. He was educated at Oxford, and in 1790 entered Parliament
  as member for the Carnarvon boroughs. In 1793 he entered the army, and in
  1794 he took part in the campaign in Flanders under the Duke of York. In
  1808 he was sent into Spain with two brigades of cavalry to join Sir John
  Moore, and in the retreat to Coruña commanded the rear-guard. In 1812 he
  became, by his father's death, Earl of Uxbridge. On Napoleon's escape
  from Elba he was appointed commander of the British cavalry, and at the
  <!-- Page 166 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page166"></a>[166]</span>battle of Waterloo, by the charge of the
  heavy brigade, overthrew the Imperial Guard. For his services he was
  created Marquess of Anglesey. In 1828 he became Lord-Lieutenant of
  Ireland and made himself extremely popular, but was recalled in
  consequence of favouring Catholic Emancipation. He was again
  Lord-Lieutenant in 1830, but lost his popularity by his opposition to
  O'Connell and his instrumentality in the passing of the Irish Coercion
  Acts; and he quitted office in 1833. From 1846-52 he was Master-General
  of the Ordnance. He died in 1854.</p>

  <p><b>Anglicanism</b>, the term is capable of a wider use, but is usually
  employed as descriptive of the type of doctrine formulated by the Church
  of England in the period of the Protestant Reformation. The two most
  notable formularies of that period are the Confession of Faith, known as
  the Thirty-nine Articles, which assumed its present shape in 1571, and
  the Liturgy, known as the Book of Common Prayer, issued in 1559 in what
  was substantially its present shape. By the Clerical Subscription Act of
  1865 assent is required to both Prayer Book and Articles. The Articles
  are not and never were binding upon laymen.&mdash;<span

  Anglicanism</i>; F.&nbsp;Y. Kinsman, <i>Principles of Anglicanism</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Angling</b>, the art of catching fish with a hook or <i>angle</i>
  (A. Sax. <i>angel</i>) baited with worms, small fish, flies, &amp;c. We
  find occasional allusions to this pursuit among the Greek and Latin
  classical writers; it is mentioned several times in the Old Testament,
  and it was practised by the ancient Egyptians. The first reference to
  angling in England is a passage in a tract, entitled <i>Piers Fulham</i>,
  supposed to have been written about the year 1420. The oldest work on the
  subject in English is the <i>Treatyse of Fysshinge with an Angle</i>,
  printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1496, along with a treatise on hunting and
  hawking, the whole being ascribed to Dame Juliana Berners or Barnes,
  prioress of a nunnery near St. Albans. Walton's inimitable discourse on
  angling was first printed in 1653. The chief appliances required by an
  angler are a rod, line, hooks, and baits. Rods are made of various
  materials, and of various sizes. The cane rods are lightest, and where
  fishing-tackle is sold they most commonly have the preference; but in
  country places the rod is often of the angler's own manufacture. Rods are
  commonly made in separate joints, so as to be easily taken to pieces and
  put up again. They are made to taper from the butt end to the top, and
  are usually possessed of a considerable amount of elasticity. In length
  they may vary from 10 feet to more than double that length, with a
  corresponding difference in strength&mdash;a rod for salmon being
  necessarily much stronger than one suited for ordinary burn trout. The
  <i>reel</i>, an apparatus for winding up the line, is attached to the rod
  near the lower end, where the hand grasps it while fishing. The best are
  usually made of brass, are of simple construction, and so made as to wind
  or unwind freely and rapidly. That part of the line which passes along
  the rod and is wound on the reel is called the <i>reel line</i>, and may
  vary from 20 to 100 yards in length, according to the size of the water
  and the habits of the fish angled for; it is usually made of twisted
  horse-hair and silk, or of oiled silk alone. The casting line, which is
  attached to this, is made of the same materials, but lighter and finer.
  To the end of this is tied a piece of fine gut, on which the hook, or
  hooks, are fixed. The casting or gut lines should decrease in thickness
  from the reel line to the hooks. The hook, of finely-tempered steel,
  should readily bend without breaking, and yet retain a sharp point. It
  should be long in the shank and deep in the bend; the point straight and
  true to the level of the shank; and the barb long. Their sizes and sorts
  must of course entirely depend on the kind of fish that is angled for.
  Floats formed of cork, goose and swan quills, &amp;c., are often used to
  buoy up the hook so that it may float clear of the bottom. For heavy fish
  or strong streams a cork float is used; in slow water and for lighter
  fish quill floats. <i>Baits</i> may consist of a great variety of
  materials, natural or artificial. The principal natural baits are worms:
  common garden worms, brandlings, and red worms, maggots, or gentles (the
  larvæ of blow-flies such as are found on putrid meat), insects, small
  fish (as minnows), salmon roe, &amp;c. The artificial flies so much used
  in angling for trout and salmon are composed of hairs, furs, and wools of
  every variety, mingled with pieces of feathers, and secured together by
  plaited wire, or gold and silver thread, marking-silk, wax, &amp;c. The
  wings may be made of the feathers of domestic fowls, or any others of a
  showy colour. Some angling authorities recommend that the artificial
  flies should be made to resemble as closely as possible the insects on
  which the fish is wont to feed, but experience has shown that the most
  capricious and unnatural combinations of feather, fur, &amp;c., have been
  often successful where the most realistic imitations have failed.
  Artificial minnows, or other small fish, are also used by way of bait,
  and are so contrived as to spin rapidly when drawn through the water in
  order to attract the notice of the fish angled for. Angling, especially
  with the fly, demands a great deal of skill and practice, the casting of
  the line properly being the initial difficulty. Nowhere is the art
  pursued with greater success and enthusiasm than in Britain and the
  United States.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: <i>Fishing</i>

  churches which hold the principles of the English Reformation, the
  Anglican or Established Church of England and the allied churches. The
  term is also applied to that party in the English Church which favours
  doctrines and religious forms closely approaching those of the Roman
  Catholic Church, objects to be called Protestant, and corresponds closely
  with the <i>Ritualistic</i> section of the Church.</p>

  <p><b>Anglo-Saxons</b>, the name commonly given to the nation or people
  formed by the amalgamation of the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, who settled
  in Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries after Christ, the
  Anglo-Saxons being simply the English people of the earlier period of
  English history. The tribes who were thus the ancestors of the bulk of
  the English-speaking nationalities came from North Germany, where they
  inhabited the parts about the mouths of the Elbe and Weser, and the first
  body of them who gained a footing in Britain are said to have landed in
  449, and to have been led by Hengist and Horsa. From the preponderance of
  the Angles the whole country came to be called <i>Engla-land</i>, that
  is, the land of the Angles or English.</p>

  <p>Many scholars object to the term 'Anglo-Saxon' as being inaccurate and
  open to misinterpretation. Correctly used, Anglo-Saxon means
  <i>English-Saxon</i>, as distinguished from the Old-Saxon of the
  Continent; incorrectly used, as it has been too frequently, it is taken
  as = Angle + Saxon, a union of Angle and Saxon. Camden (1551-1623) is
  responsible for the widespread use of the term; ignorance is responsible
  for the misuse. Many scholars prefer to apply the term 'Old English' to
  the language and people of England before <span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  1100, partly because this term is more accurate and partly because its
  use helps to emphasize the essential continuity of the language.</p>

  <p>The whole Anglo-Saxon community was frequently spoken of as consisting
  of the <i>eorls</i> and the <i>ceorls</i>, or the nobles and common
  freemen. The former were the men of property and position, the latter
  were the small landholders, handicraftsmen, &amp;c., who generally placed
  themselves under the protection of some nobleman, who was hence termed
  their <i>hláford</i> or lord. Besides these there was the class of the
  serfs or slaves (<i>theówas</i>), who might be either born slaves or
  freemen who had forfeited their liberty by their crimes, or whom poverty
  or the fortune of war had brought into this position. They served as
  agricultural labourers on their masters' estates, and were mere chattels,
  as absolutely the property of their master as his cattle.</p>

  <p>The king (<i>cyning</i>, <i>cyng</i>) was at the head of the State; he
  was the highest of the nobles and the chief magistrate. He was not looked
  upon as ruling by any Divine Right, but by the will of the people, as
  represented by the <i>witan</i> (wise men) or great council of the
  nation. The new king was not always the direct and nearest heir of the
  late king, but one of the royal family whose abilities and character
  recommended him for the office. He had the right of maintaining a
  standing army of household troops, the duty of calling together the
  <i>witan</i>, and of laying before them public measures, with certain
  distinctions of dress, dwelling, &amp;c., all his privileges being
  possessed and exercised by the advice and consent of the
  <i>witena-gemót</i> or parliament (literally, 'meeting of the wise').
  Next in rank and dignity to the king were the <i>ealdormen</i>, who were
  the chief witan or counsellors, and without whose assent laws could not
  be made, altered, or abrogated. They were at the head of the
  administration of justice in the shires, possessing both judicial and
  executive authority, and had as their officers the <i>scír-geréfan</i> or
  sheriffs. The ealdormen led the <i>fyrd</i> or armed force of the county,
  and the ealdorman, as such, held possession of certain lands attached to
  the office, and was entitled to a share of fines and other moneys levied
  for the king's use and passing through his hands. The whole executive
  government may be considered as a great aristocratical association, of
  which the ealdormen were the <!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page168"></a>[168]</span>members, and the king little more than the
  president. The ealdorman and the king were both surrounded by a number of
  followers called <i>thegnas</i> or thanes, who were bound by close ties
  to their superior. The king's thanes were the higher in rank; they
  possessed a certain quantity of land, smaller in amount than that of an
  ealdorman, and they filled offices connected with the personal service of
  the king or with the administration of justice. The <i>scir-geréfa</i>
  (shire-reeve or sheriff) was also an important functionary. He presided
  at the county court along with the ealdorman and bishop, or alone in
  their absence; and he had to carry out the decisions of the court, levy
  fines, collect taxes, &amp;c. The shires were divided into hundreds and
  tithings, the latter consisting of ten heads of families, who were
  jointly responsible to the State for the good conduct of any member of
  their body. For the trial and settlement of minor causes there was a
  hundred court held once a month. The place of the modern Parliament was
  held by the <i>witena-gemót</i>. Its members, who were not elected,
  comprised the æthelings or princes of the blood royal, the bishops and
  abbots, the ealdormen, the thanes, the sheriffs, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>One of the peculiar features of Anglo-Saxon society was the
  <i>wergyld</i>, which was established for the settling of feuds. A sum,
  paid either in kind or in money, was placed upon the life of every
  freeman, according to his rank in the State, his birth, or his office. A
  corresponding sum was settled for every wound that could be inflicted
  upon his person; for nearly every injury that could be done to his civil
  rights, his honour, or his domestic peace, &amp;c. From the operation of
  this principle no one from king to peasant was exempt.</p>

  <p>Agriculture, including especially the raising of cattle, sheep, and
  swine, was the chief occupation of the Anglo-Saxons. Gardens and orchards
  are frequently mentioned, and vineyards were common in the southern
  counties. The forests were extensive, and valuable both from the mast
  they produced for the swine, and from the beasts of the chase which they
  harboured. Hunting was a favourite recreation among the higher ranks,
  both lay and clerical. Fishing was largely carried on, herrings and
  salmon being the principal fish caught; and the Anglo-Saxon whaling
  vessels used to go as far as Iceland. The manufactures were naturally of
  small moment. Iron was made to some extent, and some cloth, and saltworks
  were numerous. In embroidery and working of gold the English were famous
  over Europe. There was a considerable trade at London, which was
  frequented by Normans, French, Flemings, and the merchants of the Hanse
  towns. Our Anglo-Saxon forefathers were notorious for their excess in
  eating and drinking, and in this respect formed a strong contrast to
  their Norman conquerors. Ale, mead, and cider were the common beverages,
  wine being limited to the higher classes. Pork and eels were favourite
  articles of food. The houses were rude structures, but were often richly
  furnished and hung with fine tapestry. The dress of the people was loose
  and flowing, composed chiefly of linen, and often adorned with
  embroidery. The men wore their hair long and flowing over their
  shoulders. Christianity was introduced among the Anglo-Saxons in the end
  of the sixth century by St. Augustine, who was sent by Pope Gregory the
  Great, and became the first Archbishop of Canterbury. Kent, then under
  King Ethelred, was the first place where it took root, and thence it soon
  spread over the rest of the country. The Anglo-Saxon Church long remained
  independent of Rome, notwithstanding the continual efforts of the Popes
  to bring it under their power. It was not till the tenth century that
  this result was brought about by Dunstan. Many Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastics
  were distinguished for learning and ability, but the Venerable Bede holds
  the first place.</p>

  <p><i>Anglo-Saxon Language.</i>&mdash;The Anglo-Saxon language, which is
  simply the earliest form of English, claims kinship with Dutch,
  Icelandic, Danish, Swedish, and German, especially with the Low German
  dialects (spoken in North Germany). It was called by those who spoke it
  <i>Englisc</i> (English). The existing remains of Anglo-Saxon literature
  show different dialects, of which the northern and the southern were the
  principal. The former was the first to be cultivated as a literary
  language, but afterwards it was supplanted in this respect by the
  southern or that of Wessex. It is in the latter that the principal
  Anglo-Saxon works are written. The Anglo-Saxon alphabet was substantially
  the same as that which we still use, except that some of the letters were
  different in form, while it had two characters either of which
  represented the sounds of <i>th</i> in <i>thy</i> and in <i>thing</i>.
  Nouns and adjectives are declined much as in German or in Latin. The
  pronouns of the first and second person had a dual number, 'we two' or
  'us two' and 'you two', besides the plural for more than two. The <!--
  Page 169 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page169"></a>[169]</span>infinitive of the verb is in <i>-an</i>,
  the participle in <i>-ende</i>, and there is a gerund somewhat similar in
  its usage to the Latin gerund. The verb had four moods&mdash;indicative,
  subjunctive, imperative, and infinitive, but only two tenses, the present
  (often used as a future) and the past. Other tenses and the passive voice
  were formed by auxiliary verbs. Anglo-Saxon words terminated in a vowel
  much more frequently than the modern English, and altogether the language
  is so different that it has to be learned quite like a foreign tongue.
  Yet, notwithstanding the large number of words of Latin or French origin
  that our language now contains, and the changes it has undergone, its
  framework, so to speak, is still Anglo-Saxon. Many chapters of the New
  Testament do not contain more than 4 per cent of non-Teutonic words, and
  as a whole it averages perhaps 6 or 7.</p>

  <p>The existing remains of Anglo-Saxon literature include compositions in
  prose and poetry, some of which must be referred to a very early period,
  one or two perhaps to a time before the Angles and Saxons emigrated to
  England. The most important Anglo-Saxon poem is the ancient epic of
  <i>Beowulf</i>, extending to more than 6000 lines. Beowulf is a
  Scandinavian prince, who slays a monster named Grendel, after
  encountering supernatural perils, and is at last slain in a contest with
  a frightful dragon. Its scene appears to be laid entirely in Scandinavia.
  Its date is uncertain; parts of it may have been brought over at the
  emigration from Germany, though in its present form it is much later than
  this. The poetical remains include a number of religious poems, or poems
  on sacred themes; ecclesiastical narratives, as lives of saints and
  versified chronicles; psalms and hymns; secular lyrics; allegories,
  gnomic poems, riddles, &amp;c. The religious class of poems was the
  largest, and of these Cædmon's (flourished about 660) are the most
  remarkable. His poems consist of paraphrases of considerable portions of
  the Bible history, and treat of the creation, the temptation, the fall,
  the exodus of the Israelites, the story of Daniel, the incarnation, and
  the harrowing of hell, or release of the ransomed souls by Christ. Other
  most interesting poems are those ascribed to Cynewulf, the <i>Christ</i>,
  <i>Elene</i>, and <i>Juliana</i>, the subjects respectively being Christ,
  the finding of the cross by the Empress Helena, and the life of Juliana.
  Rhyme was not used in Anglo-Saxon poetry, alliteration being employed
  instead, as in the older northern poetry generally. The style of the
  poetry is highly elliptical, and it is full of harsh inversions and
  obscure metaphors.</p>

  <p>The Anglo-Saxon prose remains consist of translations of portions of
  the Bible, homilies, philosophical writings, history, biography, laws,
  leases, charters, popular treatises on science and medicine, grammars,
  &amp;c. Many of these were translations from the Latin. The Anglo-Saxon
  versions of the Gospels, next to the Moeso-Gothic, are the earliest
  scriptural translations in any modern language. The Psalms are said to
  have been translated by Bishop Aldhelm (died 709), and also under
  Alfred's direction; and the <i>Gospel of St. John</i> by Bede; but it is
  not known who were the authors of the extant versions. A translation of
  the first seven books of the Bible is believed to have been the work of
  Ælfric, who was Abbot of Ensham and lived about the beginning of the
  eleventh century. We have also eighty homilies from his pen, several
  theological treatises, a Latin grammar, &amp;c. King Alfred was a
  diligent author, besides being a translator of Latin works. We have under
  his name translations of Boethius' <i>De Consolatione Philosophiæ</i>,
  the <i>Universal History</i> of Orosius, Bede's <i>Ecclesiastical
  History</i>, the <i>Pastoral Care</i> of Gregory the Great, &amp;c. The
  most valuable to us of the Anglo-Saxon prose writings is the <i>Saxon
  Chronicle</i>, as it is called, a collection of annals recording
  important events in the history of the country, and compiled in different
  religious houses. Of this <i>Chronicle</i> there are seven MSS. in
  existence, and the latest text comes down to 1154. A considerable body of
  laws remains, as well as a large number of charters. The whole of the
  literature has never yet been printed. For Anglo-Saxon history, see

  <p><b>Anglo-Saxon Law.</b> Series of laws written in the vernacular, and
  unique among Teutonic peoples, were issued from the seventh century
  onwards by Æthelberht, Hlothhere, Eadric, and Withraed, Kings of Kent, by
  Ine, King of Wessex, by Alfred, Edward the Elder, Athelstan, Edmund,
  Edgar, Æthelred, and Canute, in <!-- Page 170 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page170"></a>[170]</span>addition to a number of important by-laws
  and regulations of various kinds, which bear no king's name. We hear,
  also, of laws issued by other kings which have been lost, and there must
  have been a considerable body of traditional law which was never
  committed to writing. What laws are extant, show us a society mainly
  agricultural, divided by birth into a noble, a free peasant, and a
  servile class. There was also a dependent class in Kent, intermediate
  between the freeman and the slave. The strongest social ties were those
  of the kindred, and the relationship between lord and man.</p>

  <p>The laws were issued by the king and his councillors. Cases were
  decided by the production of oaths which varied in value according to the
  rank of the swearer, or by the several forms of the ordeal. No
  distinction was made between civil and criminal law, and even homicide
  could be atoned for by payment of a sum varying according to the social
  status of the dead man. The object of the laws was to restrict private
  vengeance, to prevent and punish theft (primarily of cattle), to stop
  dishonest trading, to secure the persons and residences of the people, to
  enforce the mutual obligations of relatives, and masters and men, to
  provide adequate defence for the kingdom by means of garrisoned boroughs
  and a well-armed mounted infantry, to protect the helpless, and to
  safeguard the rights of the Church and its servants.</p>

  <p>The early laws present considerable difficulty owing to their
  antiquity. The laws of Æthelberht are the earliest records in the English
  language, though, like many of the other laws, they are only preserved in
  a MS. of the twelfth century. The standard edition is Liebermann's
  <i>Gesetze der Angelsachsen</i> (Halle, A.&nbsp;S. Max Niemeyer).&mdash;<span

  flax, rape, potatoes, tobacco, hops, and fruit. Excellent cattle are
  bred. The inhabitants are principally occupied in agriculture, though
  there are some iron-works and manufactures of woollens, linens,
  beet-sugar, tobacco, &amp;c. The dukes of Anhalt traced their origin to
  Bernard (1170-1212), son of Albert the Bear. In time the family split up
  into numerous branches, and the territory was afterwards held by three
  dukes (Anhalt-Köthen, Anhalt-Bernburg, and Anhalt-Dessau). In 1863 the
  Duke of Anhalt-Dessau became sole heir to the three duchies. The united
  principality, incorporated in the German Empire, had one vote in the
  Bundesrath and two in the Reichstag. The executive power, previous to the
  changes resulting from the European War, was vested in the duke, and the
  legislative in a Diet of thirty-six members. The reigning duke in 1918
  was Eduard, who succeeded his brother on 21st April, 1918. With the
  outbreak of the revolution in Germany in 1918 Anhalt became a republic,
  but its status in the German Republic still remains to be determined.

  <p><b>An´iline</b>, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>, is an
  extremely important substance as it forms the starting-point in the
  preparation of a large number of substances. It was first prepared by
  Unverdorben, in 1826, by distillation of indigo. Aniline is present in
  small quantity in coal-tar, and is prepared commercially from benzene by
  transforming it by means of nitric acid into nitro-benzene and reducing
  this with scrap-iron and hydrochloric acid. The substance can also be
  prepared by reducing nitro-benzene electrolytically. It is a liquid of
  peculiar odour, boiling at 182° C., colourless when quite pure, but
  rapidly darkening in colour on standing, so that commercial aniline is
  usually dark-brown. It is a basic substance, and forms crystalline salts
  with acids. The salts, like aniline itself, become coloured on exposure
  to air. Aniline contains the characteristic chemical group
  NH<sub>2</sub>, the amino group, and substances containing this group
  react with nitrous acid at 0° C., forming diazonium compounds; these
  combine readily with phenols, naphthols, and other amino compounds to
  form azo compounds, highly-coloured compounds many of which are dyes.
  Many dyes are prepared from aniline, e.g. rosaniline, magenta, methylene
  blue, aniline blue, &amp;c., also some explosives, e.g. tetranitraniline,
  which is a powerful explosive prepared by nitrating aniline and the
  substance tetranitromethylaniline, <!-- Page 172 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page172"></a>[172]</span>"tetryl", used in
  detonators. Several medicinal substances are also prepared from aniline,
  for instance, antifebrin and atoxyl.</p>

  <p><b>An´ilism</b>, aniline poisoning, a name given to the aggregate of
  symptoms which often show themselves in those employed in aniline works,
  resulting from the inhalation of aniline vapours. It may be either acute
  or chronic. In a slight attack of the former kind, the lips, cheeks, and
  ears become of a bluish colour, and the person's walk may be unsteady; in
  severe cases there is loss of consciousness. Chronic anilism is
  accompanied by derangement of the digestive organs and of the nervous
  system, headaches, eruptions on the skin, muscular weakness, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Animal</b>, an organized and sentient living being. Life in the
  earlier periods of natural history was attributed almost exclusively to
  animals. With the progress of science, however, it was extended to
  plants. In the case of the higher animals and plants there is no
  difficulty in assigning the individual to one of the two great kingdoms
  of organic nature, but in their lowest manifestations the vegetable and
  animal kingdoms are brought into such immediate contact that it becomes
  almost impossible to assign them precise limits, and to say with
  certainty where the one begins and the other ends. From <i>form</i> no
  absolute distinction can be fixed between animals and plants. Many
  animals, such as the sea-shrubs, sea-mats, &amp;c., so resemble plants in
  external appearance that they were, and even yet popularly are, looked
  upon as such. With regard to <i>internal structure</i> no line of
  demarcation can be laid down, all plants and animals being, in this
  respect, fundamentally similar; that is, alike composed of molecular,
  cellular, and fibrous tissues. Neither are the chemical characters of
  animal and vegetable substances more distinct. Animals contain in their
  tissues and fluids a larger proportion of nitrogen than plants, whilst
  plants are richer in carbonaceous compounds than the former. In some
  animals, moreover, substances almost exclusively confined to plants are
  found. Thus the outer wall of the Sea-squirts contains <i>cellulose</i>,
  a substance largely found in plant-tissues; whilst <i>chlorophyll</i>,
  the colouring-matter of plants, occurs in Hydra and many other lower
  animals. <i>Power of motion</i>, again, though broadly distinctive of
  animals, cannot be said to be absolutely characteristic of them. Thus
  many animals, as oysters, sponges, corals, &amp;c., in their mature
  condition are rooted or fixed, while the embryos of many plants, together
  with numerous fully-developed forms, are endowed with locomotive power by
  means of vibratile, hair-like processes called cilia. The distinctive
  points between animals and plants which are most to be relied on are
  those derived from the <i>nature and mode of assimilation of the
  food</i>. Plants feed on <i>inorganic matters</i>, consisting of water,
  ammonia, carbonic acid, and mineral matters. They can only take in food
  which is presented to them in a <i>liquid</i> or <i>gaseous</i> state.
  The exceptions to these rules are found chiefly in the case of plants
  which live <i>parasitically</i> on other plants or animals, in which
  cases the plant may be said to feed on organic matters, represented by
  the juices of their hosts. Animals, on the contrary, require
  <i>organized</i> matters for food. They feed either upon plants or upon
  other animals. But even carnivorous animals can be shown to be dependent
  upon plants for subsistence; since the animals upon which Carnivora prey
  are in their turn supported by plants. Animals, further, can subsist on
  <i>solid</i> food in addition to liquids and gases; but many animals
  (such as the Tapeworms) live by the mere imbibition of fluids which are
  absorbed by their tissues, such forms possessing no distinct digestive
  system. Animals require a due supply of <i>oxygen gas</i> for their
  sustenance, this gas being used in respiration. Plants, on the contrary,
  require <i>carbonic acid</i>. The animal exhales or gives out carbonic
  acid as the part result of its tissue-waste, whilst the plant, taking in
  this gas, is enabled to decompose it into its constituent carbon and
  oxygen. The plant retains the former for the uses of its economy, and
  liberates the oxygen, which is thus restored to the atmosphere for the
  use of the animal. Animals receive their food into the interior of their
  bodies, and assimilation takes place in their internal surfaces. Plants,
  on the other hand, receive their food into their external surfaces, and
  assimilation is effected in the external parts, as is exemplified in the
  leaf-surfaces under the influence of sunlight. Cf. T.&nbsp;J. Parker and W.&nbsp;A.

  <p><b>Animalcule</b> (an-i-mal´k&#x16B;l), a general name given to many
  forms of animal life from their minute size. The larger examples are just
  visible to the naked eye, but most of them are strictly <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `miscroscopic'."
  >microscopic</span>. Some are pigmented, but the majority are colourless.
  The term is not applicable to a particular zoological type, but it is
  customary to confine it to the 'Protozoa', 'Rotifera', or 'Wheel
  Animalcules'.</p>

  <p><b>Animal Heat.</b> All animals possess a certain amount of heat or
  temperature which is necessary for the performance of vital action. The
  only classes of animals in which a constantly-elevated temperature is
  kept up are birds and mammals. The bodily heat of the former varies from
  39.4° to 43.9° C., and of the latter from 35.5° to 40.5° C. The mean or
  average heat of the human body is about 99° F., and it never falls much
  below this in health. Below birds, animals are named 'cold-blooded', this
  term meaning in its <!-- Page 173 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page173"></a>[173]</span>strictly-physiological sense that their
  temperature is usually that of the medium in which they live, and that it
  varies with that of the surrounding medium. The temperature of
  'warm-blooded' animals is remarkably constant, although there are
  individual variations. In man this variation is slight, amounting only to
  fractions of a degree. The cause of the evolution of heat in the animal
  body is referred to the union (by a process resembling ordinary
  combustion) of the carbon and hydrogen of the system with the oxygen
  taken in from the air in the process of respiration.</p>

  <p><b>Animal Magnetism.</b> See <i>Hypnotism</i>, <i>Mesmer</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Animals, Cruelty to</b>, an offence against which societies have
  been formed and laws passed in England and other countries. According to
  English law, if any person shall cruelly beat, ill-treat, overdrive,
  abuse, or torture any domestic animal, he shall forfeit a sum not
  exceeding £5 for every such offence. Bull-baiting, cock-fighting, and the
  like are also prohibited. Provision is also made for the punishment of
  persons unlawfully and maliciously killing, maiming, or wounding cattle,
  dogs, birds, beasts, and other animals.</p>

  <p><b>Animal Worship</b>, a practice found to prevail, or to have
  prevailed, in the most widely-distant parts of the world, both the Old
  and the New, but nowhere to such an amazing extent as in ancient Egypt,
  notwithstanding its high civilization. Nearly all the more important
  animals found in the country were regarded as sacred in some part of
  Egypt, and the degree of reverence paid to them was such that throughout
  Egypt the killing of a hawk or an ibis, whether voluntary or not, was
  punished with death. The worship, however, was not, except in a few
  instances, paid to them as actual deities. The animals were merely
  regarded as sacred to the deities, and the worship paid to them was
  symbolical.</p>

  <p><b>An´ima Mun´di.</b> See <i>Pantheism</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Animé</b> (an´i-me), a resin obtained from the trunk of an American
  tree (<i>Hymenæa Courbaril</i>). It is of a transparent amber colour, has
  a light, agreeable smell, and is soluble in alcohol. It strongly
  resembles copal, and, like it, is used in making varnishes. See
  <i>Copal</i>.</p>

  <p><b>An´imism</b>, the system of medicine propounded by Stahl, and based
  on the idea that the soul (<i>anima</i>) is the seat of life. In modern
  usage the term is applied to express the general doctrine of souls and
  other spiritual beings, and especially to the tendency, common among
  savage races, to attribute souls or spirits to inanimate things, and to
  explain phenomena not due to obvious natural causes by attributing them
  to spiritual agency. Amongst the beliefs of animism is that of a human
  apparitional soul, bearing the form and appearance of the body, and
  living after death a sort of semi-human life.&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Anio</b> (now <b>Ani&#x113;ne</b> or <b>Tever&#x14D;ne</b>), a
  river in Italy, a tributary of the Tiber, which it enters from the east a
  short distance above Rome, renowned for the natural beauties of the
  valley through which it flows, and for the remains of ancient buildings
  there situated, as the villas of Mæcenas and the Emperor Hadrian.</p>

  <p><b>Anise</b> (an´is; <i>Pimpinella An&#x12B;sum</i>), an annual plant
  of the nat. ord. Umbelliferæ, a native of Eastern Asia, Egypt, and the
  Mediterranean coasts, and cultivated in Spain, France, Italy, Malta,
  &amp;c., whence the fruit, popularly called <i>aniseed</i>, is imported.
  This fruit is ovate, with ten narrow ribs, between which are oil-vessels.
  It has an aromatic smell, and is largely employed to flavour liqueurs
  (aniseed or anisette), sweetmeats, &amp;c. <i>Star-anise</i> is the fruit
  of an evergreen Asiatic tree (<i>Illicium anis&#x101;tum</i>), nat. ord.
  Magnoliaceæ, and is brought chiefly from China. Its flavour is similar to
  that of anise, and it is used for the same purposes. An essential oil is
  obtained from both kinds of anise, and is used for scenting soaps and in
  the preparation of cordials.</p>

  <p><b>Anjou</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>n<span class="x1"><span
  class="x3">&#x2D9;</span></span>-zhö), an ancient province of France, now
  forming the department of Maine-et-Loire, and parts of the departments of
  Indre-et-Loire, Mayenne, and Sarthe; area, about 3000 sq. miles. In 1060
  the province passed into the hands of the House of Gatinais, of which
  sprang Count Godfrey V, who, in 1127, married Matilda, daughter of Henry
  I of England, and so became the ancestor of the Plantagenet kings. Anjou
  remained in the possession of the English kings up to 1204, when John
  lost it to the French king Philip Augustus. In 1226 Louis VIII bestowed
  this province on his brother Charles; but in 1328 it was reunited to the
  French Crown. John I raised it to the rank of a duchy, and gave it to his
  son Louis. Henceforth it remained separate from the French Crown till
  1480, when it fell to Louis XI.</p>

  <p><b>Ankarström</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>n´ka<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>r-streum), Jan Jakob, the murderer of
  Gustavus III of Sweden, was born about 1762, and was at first a page in
  the Swedish Court, afterwards an officer in the royal bodyguard. He was a
  strenuous opponent of the sovereign's measures to restrict the privileges
  of the nobility, and joined Counts Horn and Ribbing in a plot to
  assassinate Gustavus. The assassination took place on 15th March, 1792.
  Ankarström was tried, tortured, and executed in April, dying boasting of
  his deed.</p>

  <p><b>Anker</b>, an obsolete measure used in Britain for spirits, beer,
  &amp;c., containing 8½ imperial gallons. A measure of similar capacity
  was used in Germany and elsewhere in Europe. <!-- Page 174 --><span

  <p><b>An´klam</b>, a town in Prussia, province of Pomerania, 47 miles
  north-west of Stettin, on the River Peene, which is here navigable.
  Shipbuilding, woollen and cotton manufactures, soap-boiling, tanning,
  &amp;c., are carried on. Pop. 15,280.</p>

  <p><b>Anko´bar</b>, or <b>Anko´ber</b>, a town in Abyssinia, former
  capital of Shoa, on a steep conical hill 8200 feet high. Pop. 2000.</p>

  <p><b>Ankylo´sis</b>, or <b>Anchylo´sis</b>, stiffness of the joints
  caused by a more or less complete coalescence of the bones through
  ossification, often the result of inflammation or injury. False ankylosis
  is stiffness of a joint when the disease is not in the joint itself, but
  in the tendinous and muscular parts by which it is surrounded.</p>

  <p><b>Ankylostomi´asis</b>, a 'worm disease' to which miners are subject
  in some localities, is caused by vast numbers of small parasitic worms
  (<i>Ankylostoma</i> or <i>Anchylostoma duodenale</i>) in the duodenum or
  upper portions of the intestinal canal. Deriving their sustenance from
  the system, these worms produce anæmia or bloodlessness (that is,
  deficiency of the red corpuscles of the blood), the sufferers being
  pallid, feeble, short-breathed, liable to faint, and unequal to any
  laborious work, and death may result if a cure is not effected.
  Fortunately the disease is not difficult to cure if the remedies are
  applied&mdash;remedies such as will expel the worms from the intestine.
  The disease is said to be common in tropical and sub-tropical countries
  all over the world. In Europe it was perhaps first observed in 1879 in
  the case of workmen engaged in excavating the St. Gothard tunnel. Since
  1896 it has been well known in some of the German mines; and in 1903 it
  was detected among the miners engaged in the Dolcoath mine in Cornwall.
  The eggs of the worms are carried from the body with the fæces; under
  favourable circumstances they develop into larvæ, which may gain entrance
  again into the human body by the mouth (perhaps in drinking-water), to
  attain full development in the intestine. Careful sanitary arrangements
  are a preventive of the disease, which is also known as 'miner's worm',
  'miner's anæmia', &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Ann</b>, or <b>Annat</b>, in Scottish law, the half-year's stipend
  of a living, after the death of the clergyman, payable to his family or
  next of kin. The right to the ann is not vested in the clergyman himself,
  but in his representatives; and, accordingly, it can neither be disposed
  of by him nor attached for his debts.</p>

  <p><b>Anna</b>, an Anglo-Indian money of account, the sixteenth part of a
  rupee, and of the value of one penny; it is divided into four pice.</p>

  <p><b>An´naberg</b>, a town in Saxony, 47 miles south-west of Dresden.
  Mining (for silver, cobalt, iron, &amp;c.) is carried on, and there are
  manufactures of lace, ribbons, fringes, buttons, &amp;c. Pop. 17,025.</p>

  <p><b>Anna Comne´na</b>, daughter of Alexius I, Comnenus, Byzantine
  emperor. She was born 1083, and died 1148. After her father's death she
  endeavoured to secure the succession for her husband, Nicephorus
  Briennius, but was baffled by his want of energy and ambition. She wrote
  (in Greek) a life of her father Alexius (<i>The Alexiad</i>, a work in
  fifteen books). She is a character in Sir Walter Scott's <i>Count Robert
  of Paris</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Anna Ivanov´na</b>, Empress of Russia, born in 1693, the daughter
  of Ivan, the elder half-brother of Peter the Great. She was married in
  1710 to the Duke of Courland, in the following year was left a widow, and
  in 1730 ascended the throne of the tsars on the condition proposed by the
  senate, that she would limit the absolute power of the tsars, and do
  nothing without the advice of the council composed of the leading members
  of the Russian aristocracy. But no sooner had she ascended the throne
  than she declared her promise null, and proclaimed herself autocrat of
  all the Russias. She chose as her favourite Ernest John von Biren or
  Biron, who was soon all-powerful in Russia, and ruled with great
  severity. Several of the leading nobles were executed, and many thousand
  men exiled to Siberia. In 1737 Anna forced the Courlanders to choose
  Biren as their duke, and nominated him at her death regent of the empire
  during the minority of Prince Ivan (of Brunswick). Anna died in 1740. See
  <i>Biren</i>.</p>

  <p><b>An´nals</b>, a history of events in chronological order, each event
  being recorded under the year in which it occurred. The name is derived
  from the first annual records of the Romans, which were called
  <i>ann&#x101;les pontificum</i> or <i>ann&#x101;les max&#x12D;mi</i>,
  drawn up by the <i>pontifex maximus</i> (chief pontiff). The practice of
  keeping such annals was afterwards adopted also by various private
  individuals, as by Fabius Pictor, Calpurnius Piso, and others. The name
  hence came to be applied in later times to historical works in which the
  matter was treated with special reference to chronological arrangement,
  as to the <i>Annals</i> of Tacitus.</p>

  <p><b>Annam´</b>, a country of Asia occupying the east side of the
  South-eastern or Indo-Chinese Peninsula, along the China Sea. It
  comprises Tonquin in the north, Annam (in a narrower sense), and
  Cochin-China farther south; with the inland territory of the Laos tribes:
  together, area, 170,000 sq. miles; pop. 15,000,000, 9,000,000 being in
  Tonquin. In the narrow sense Annam now denotes the country between
  Tonquin and French Cochin-China, under the nominal rule of a native king
  (the present ruler, Khai-Dinh, succeeded to the throne in 1916). Annam
  has an <!-- Page 175 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page175"></a>[175]</span>area of 52,100 sq. miles. Pop. (1919),
  5,952,000, including 2117 Europeans. The coast is considerably indented,
  especially at the mouths of the rivers, where it affords many commodious
  harbours. Tonquin is mountainous on the north, but in the east is nearly
  level, terminating towards the sea in an alluvial plain yielding good
  crops of rice, cotton, fruits, ginger, and spices, and a great variety of
  varnish trees, palms, &amp;c. The principal river is the Song-ka, which
  has numerous tributaries, many of them being joined together by canals,
  both for irrigation and commerce. Tonquin is rich in gold, silver,
  copper, and iron. Annam (in the narrow sense) is, generally speaking,
  unproductive, but contains many fertile spots, in which grain, leguminous
  plants, sugar-cane, cinnamon, &amp;c., are produced in great abundance.
  Agriculture is the chief occupation, but many of the inhabitants are
  engaged in the spinning and weaving of cotton and silk into coarse
  fabrics, the preparation of varnish, iron-smelting, and the construction
  of ships or junks. The inhabitants are said to be the ugliest of the
  Mongoloid races of the peninsula, being under the middle size and less
  robust than the surrounding peoples. Their language is monosyllabic, and
  is connected with the Chinese. The religion of the majority is Buddhism,
  but the educated classes hold the doctrines of Confucius. The principal
  towns are Hanoi, the capital of Tonquin, and Huë, the capital of the
  kingdom and formerly of the whole empire. Annam was conquered by the
  Chinese in 214 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, but in <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1428 it completely won its independence. The
  French began to interfere actively in its affairs in 1847 on the plea of
  protecting the native Christians. By the treaties of 1862 and 1867 they
  obtained the southern and most productive part of Cochin-China,
  subsequently known as French Cochin-China; and in 1874 they obtained
  large powers over Tonquin, notwithstanding the protests of the Chinese.
  Finally, in 1883, Tonquin was ceded to France, and next year Annam was
  declared a French protectorate. After a short period of hostilities with
  China the latter recognized the French claims, and Tonquin is now a
  French colony, while the kingdom of Annam is, since 1886, entirely under
  French direction. Cf. F.&nbsp;R. Eberhardt, <i>Guide de l' Annam</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Annates</b> (an´n&#x101;ts), a year's income claimed for many
  centuries by the Pope on the death of any bishop, abbot, or parish
  priest, to be paid by his successor. In England they were at first paid
  to the Archbishop of Canterbury, but were afterwards appropriated by the
  Popes. In 1532 the Parliament gave them to the Crown; but in 1703 Queen
  Anne restored them to the Church by applying them to the augmentation of
  poor livings. See <i>Queen Anne's Bounty</i>.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b>Annat´to</b>, or <b>Annato</b>, an orange-red colouring matter,
  obtained from the pulp surrounding the seeds of <i>Bixa
  Orell&#x101;na</i>, a shrub native to tropical America, and cultivated in
  Guiana, St. Domingo, and the East Indies. It is sometimes used as a dye
  for silk and cotton goods, though it does not produce a very durable
  colour, but it is much used in medicine for tinging plasters and
  ointments, and to a considerable extent by farmers for giving a rich
  colour to milk, butter, and cheese. The colour given by annatto
  approaches very <!-- Page 176 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  milk fat. It is guaranteed to preserve the same colour throughout the
  year, and is considered to be a legitimate colouring matter.</p>

  <p><b>Anne</b>, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland was born at
  Twickenham, near London, 6th Feb., 1664. She was the second daughter of
  James II, then Duke of York, and Anne, his wife, daughter of the Earl of
  Clarendon. With her father's permission she was educated according to the
  principles of the English Church. In 1683 she was married to Prince
  George, brother of King Christian V of Denmark. On the arrival of the
  Prince of Orange in 1688, Anne wished to remain with her father; but she
  was prevailed upon by Lord Churchill (afterwards Duke of Marlborough) and
  his wife to join the triumphant party. After the death of William III in
  1702 she ascended the English throne. Her character was essentially weak,
  and she was governed first by Marlborough and his wife, and afterwards by
  Mrs. Masham. Most of the principal events of her reign are connected with
  the war of the Spanish Succession. The only important acquisition that
  England made by it was Gibraltar, which was captured in 1704. Another
  very important event of this reign was the union of England and Scotland
  under the name of Great Britain, which was accomplished in 1707. Anne
  seems to have long cherished the wish of securing the succession to her
  brother James, but this was frustrated by the internal dissensions of the
  cabinet. Grieved at the disappointment of her secret wishes, she fell
  into a state of weakness and lethargy, and died, 20th July, 1714. The
  reign of Anne was distinguished not only by the brilliant successes of
  the British arms, but also on account of the number of admirable and
  excellent writers who flourished at this time, among whom were Pope,
  Swift, and Addison. Anne bore her husband many children, all of whom died
  in infancy, except one son, the Duke of Gloucester, who died at the age
  of twelve.</p>

  <p><b>Anne</b> (of Austria), daughter of Philip III of Spain, was born at
  Madrid in 1602, and in 1615 was married to Louis XIII of France.
  Richelieu, fearing the influence of her foreign connections, did
  everything he could to humble her. In 1643 her husband died, and she was
  left regent, but placed under the control of a council. But the
  Parliament overthrew this arrangement, and entrusted her with full
  sovereign rights during the minority of her son Louis XIV. Having brought
  upon herself the hatred of the nobles by her boundless confidence in
  Cardinal Mazarin, she was forced to flee from Paris during the wars of
  the Fronde. She ultimately quelled all opposition, and was able in 1661
  to transmit to her son unimpaired the royal authority. She spent the
  remainder of her life in retirement, and died 20th Jan., 1666.</p>

  <p><b>Annealing</b> (an-&#x113;l´ing), a process to which many articles
  of metal and glass are subjected after making, in order to render them
  more tenacious and which consists in heating them and allowing them to
  cool slowly. When the metals are worked by the hammer, or rolled into
  plates, or drawn into wire, they acquire a certain amount of brittleness,
  which destroys their usefulness, and has to be remedied by annealing. The
  tempering of steel is one kind of annealing. Annealing is particularly
  employed in glass-houses, and consists in putting the glass vessels, as
  soon as they are formed and while they are yet hot, into a furnace or
  oven, in which they are suffered to cool gradually. The toughness is
  greatly increased by cooling the articles in oil.</p>

  <p><b>Annecy</b> (a<span class="x1"><span

  department of Haute-Savoie, situated on the Lake of Annecy, 21 miles s.
  of Geneva; contains a cathedral and a ruinous old castle once the
  residence of the counts of Genevois; manufactures of cotton, leather,
  paper, and hardware. Pop. 15,622.&mdash;The lake is about 9 miles long

    Lobworm (one of the Annelida)
  </div>

  <p><b>Annel´ida</b>, or <b>Annulata</b>, an extensive division or class
  of Annulosa or articulate animals, so called because their bodies are
  formed of a great number of small rings, the outward signs of internal
  segmentation. The earth-worm, the lobworm, the nereis, and the leech
  belong to this division. They have red, rarely yellow or green, blood
  circulating in a double system of contractile vessels, a double
  ganglionated nervous cord, and respire by external branchiæ, internal
  vesicles, or by the skin. Their organs of motion consist of bristles or
  <i>setæ</i>, which are usually attached to the lateral surfaces of each
  segment, the bristles being borne on 'foot processes' or
  <i>parapodia</i>. The number of body segments varies. As many as 400 may
  be found in some sea-worms. A complete digestive system is developed,
  consisting of a mouth&mdash;armed with horny jaws and a protrusible
  proboscis&mdash;gizzard, stomach, and intestine. See <i>Earth-worm</i>,

  applicable not only to the extension of a State's sovereignty <!-- Page
  177 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page177"></a>[177]</span>over
  adjoining territory, but also to an acquisition of a remote territory.
  The inhabitants of the annexed territory are absolved from their
  allegiance to their former sovereign. Such annexations in modern history
  were those of Alsace-Lorraine by Germany in 1871, of California by the
  United States, of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria in 1908, and of the
  Boer Republics by Great Britain.</p>

  <p><b>Annfield Plain</b>, a straggling colliery town (urban district) of
  England, Durham, about 7 miles south-west of Gateshead. Pop. (1921),

  <p><b>Annobon´</b>, or <b>Annobom</b>, a beautiful Spanish island of
  Western Africa, south of the Bight of Biafra, about 4 miles long by 2
  miles broad, and rising abruptly to the height of 3000 feet, richly
  covered with vegetation. Pop. 2000.</p>

  <p><b>Annonay</b> (a<span class="x1"><span

  department of Ardèche, 37 miles <span class="scac">S.S.W.</span> of
  Lyons, in a picturesque situation. It is the most important town of
  Ardèche, manufacturing paper and glove leather to a large extent, also
  cloth, felt, silk stuffs, gloves, hosiery, chemical manures, glue,
  gelatine, brushes, chocolate, and candles. There is an obelisk in memory
  of Joseph Montgolfier of balloon fame. Pop. 16,660.</p>

  <p><b>An´nual</b>, in botany, a plant that springs from seed, grows up,
  produces seed, and then dies, all within a single year or season. Among
  annual grasses may be noted all our cereals, barley, wheat, rye, and
  oats.</p>

  <p><b>An´nual</b>, in literature, the name given to a class of
  publications which at one time enjoyed an immense yearly circulation, and
  were distinguished by great magnificence both of binding and
  illustration, which rendered them much sought after as Christmas and New
  Year presents. Their contents were chiefly prose tales and ballads,
  lyrics, and other poetry. The earliest was the <i>Forget-me-not</i>,
  started in 1822, and followed next year by the <i>Friendship's
  Offering</i>. The <i>Literary Souvenir</i> was commenced in 1824, and the
  <i>Keepsake</i> in 1827. Among the names of the editors occur those of
  Alaric A. Watts, Mrs. S.&nbsp;C. Hall, Harrison Ainsworth, Lady Blessington,
  Mary Howitt, &amp;c. The popularity of the annuals reached its zenith
  about 1829, when no less than seventeen made their appearance; in 1856
  the <i>Keepsake</i>, the last of the series, ceased to exist.</p>

  <p><b>Annual Register</b>, an English publication commenced in 1758 by
  Dodsley, the publisher, and since continued in yearly volumes down to the
  present day. There was also an <i>Edinburgh Annual Register</i>, the
  historical part of which was for several years contributed by Sir Walter
  Scott and afterwards by Robert Southey. It commenced in 1808 and came to
  a close in 1827.</p>

  <p><b>Annu´ity</b>, a periodical payment, made annually, or at more
  frequent intervals, and continuing either a certain number of years, or
  for an uncertain period, to be determined by a particular event, as the
  death of the recipient or annuitant, or that of the party liable to pay
  the annuity; or the annuity may be perpetual. An annuity is usually
  raised by the present payment of a certain sum as a consideration whereby
  the party making the payment, or some other person named by him, becomes
  entitled to an annuity, and the rules and principles by which this
  present value is to be computed have been the subjects of careful
  investigation. The present value of a perpetual annuity is evidently a
  sum of money that will yield an interest equal to the annuity, and
  payable at the same periods; and an annuity of this description, payable
  quarterly, will evidently be of greater value than one of the same amount
  payable annually, since the annuitant has the additional advantage of the
  interest on three of the quarterly payments until the expiration of the
  year. In other words, it requires a greater present capital to be put at
  interest to yield a given sum per annum, payable quarterly, than to yield
  the same annual sum payable at the end of each year. The present value of
  an annuity for a limited period is a sum which, if put at interest, will
  at the end of that period give an amount equal to the sum of all the
  payments of the annuity and interest; and, accordingly, if it be proposed
  to invest a certain sum of money in the purchase of an annuity for a
  given number of years, the comparative value of the two may be precisely
  estimated, the rate of interest being given. But annuities for uncertain
  periods, and particularly life annuities, are more frequent, and the
  value of the annuity is computed according to the probable duration of
  the life by which it is limited. Such annuities are often created by
  contract, whereby the Government or a private annuity office agrees, for
  a certain sum advanced by the purchaser, to pay a certain sum in yearly,
  quarterly, or other periodical payments to the person advancing the
  money, or to some other named by him, during the life of the annuitant.
  Or the annuity may be granted to the annuitant during the life of some
  other person, or during two or more joint lives, or during the life of
  the longest liver or survivor among a number of persons named. If a
  person having a certain capital, and intending to spend this capital and
  the income of it during his own life, could know precisely how long he
  should live, he might lend his capital at a certain rate during his life,
  and by taking every year, besides the interest, a certain amount of the
  capital, he might secure the same annual amount for his support during
  his life in such manner that he should have the same sum to spend every
  year, and consume precisely his whole capital during his life. But since
  he does not know how long <!-- Page 178 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page178"></a>[178]</span>he is to live, he agrees with the
  Government or an annuity office to take the risk of the duration of his
  life, and they agree to pay him a certain annuity for life in exchange
  for the capital which he proposes to invest in this way. The probable
  duration of his life therefore becomes a subject of computation; and for
  the purpose of making this calculation tables of longevity are made by
  noting the proportion of deaths at certain ages in the same country or
  district. Founding on a comparison of many such tables, the British
  Government has empowered the Postmaster-General to grant annuities at the
  following rates, which are probably more closely adjusted to their actual
  value than those of insurance companies and other dealers in annuities:
  To secure an immediate annuity of £100, the cost is, for males of 20
  years, £2279, 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>; for females of same age, £2482,
  10<i>s.</i>; for males of 30 years, £2045, 8<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, for
  females, £2258, <i>6s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; for males of 40 years, £1789,
  6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; for females, £1990; for males of 60, £1148,
  6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; females, £1275, 8<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>; and so on.
  <i>Deferred</i> annuities, that is, such as have their first payments
  postponed for a greater or less number of years, are also granted. We
  give the rates for an annuity of £100 deferred 20 years: Males aged 20,
  £848, 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; females, £1014, 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>;
  males aged 35, £557, 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; females, £697, 1<i>s.</i>
  8<i>d.</i>; and so on. If a person on whose life the deferred annuity is
  to depend should die before payment commences, the purchase-money may be
  returned to his or her representatives, provided that an agreement to
  that effect had been made in the first instance, but in this case the
  purchase-money is necessarily higher. See <i>Insurance</i>.&mdash;<span

  appearance, and the Echinodermata, whose embryos show traces of
  annulation.</p>

  <p><b>Annulo´sa</b>, a division (sub-kingdom) of animals regarded by some

  <p><b>Annunciation</b>, the declaration of the angel Gabriel to the
  Virgin Mary informing her that she was to become the mother of our
  Lord.&mdash;<i>Annunciation</i> or <i>Lady Day</i> is a feast of the
  Church in honour of the annunciation, celebrated on the 25th of
  March.&mdash;The Italian order of <i>Knights of the Annunciation</i> was
  instituted by Amadeus VI, Duke of Savoy, in 1360. The king is always
  grand-master. The knights must be of high rank, and must already be
  members of the order of St. Mauritius and St. Lazarus. The decoration of
  the order consists of a golden shield suspended from a chain or collar of
  roses and knots, the letters F.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;T. being inscribed on the roses,
  and standing for <i>Fortitudo ejus Rhodum tenuit</i> (its bravery held
  Rhodes).&mdash;There are two orders of <i>nuns of the Annunciation</i>,
  one originally French, founded in 1501 by Joanna of Valois; the other
  Italian, founded in 1604 by Maria Vittoria Fornari of Genoa.</p>

  <p><b>Annunzio</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>n-nu<span class="x1"><span
  class="x3">&#xA8;</span></span>nt´sy&#x14D;), Gabriele d', Italian poet,
  novelist, and dramatist, born at Pescara in 1863, his patronymic being
  Rapagnetta. He was educated at Prato and in Rome, and early took to
  literature and journalism. In 1898 he was elected a member of the Italian
  Chamber of Deputies, in which he joined the Socialist party. He came
  before the public when a schoolboy with a volume of verse called <i>Primo
  Vere</i>, to which others&mdash;naturally much more mature&mdash;were
  subsequently added. Several of his novels have been published in English,
  as: <i>The Child of Pleasure</i>, <i>The Victim</i>, <i>The Triumph of
  Death</i>, <i>The Virgin of the Rocks</i>, <i>The Fire of Life</i>. Some
  of these have been very successful, though disfigured to some extent by
  coarse realism and voluptuousness. He began to write plays later in life.
  Among them <i>Gioconda</i>, <i>The Dead City</i>, and <i>Francesca da
  Rimini</i> may be read in English versions, and <i>Gioconda</i> and
  <i>Francesca</i> have been performed on the English stage. His more
  recent works include: <i>Le Martyr de Saint Sebastien</i> (1911), <i>Le
  Chèvrefeuille</i> (1914), <i>La Beffa di Buccari</i> (1918),
  <i>Notturno</i> (1918). D'Annunzio is the most prominent Italian writer
  of the present day, and in wealth of language and distinction of style
  stands far ahead of all others. He served in the European War from
  1915-18, and was wounded. In Sept., 1919, he led a raid and occupied the
  port of Fiume. See <i>European War</i> and <i>Fiume</i>.</p>

  <p><b>An´oa</b>, an animal (<i>Anoa depressicornis</i>) closely allied to
  the buffalo, about the size of an average sheep, very wild and fierce,
  inhabiting the rocky and mountainous localities of the Island of Celebes.
  The horns are straight, thick at the root, and set nearly in a line with
  the forehead.</p>

  <p><b>Ano´bium</b>, a genus of coleopterous insects, the larvae of which
  often do much damage by their boring into old wood. By means of their
  heads they produce a loud, ticking sound in the wood, the so-called
  <i>death-watch</i> ticking. <i>A. stri&#x101;tum</i>, a common species,
  when frightened, is much given to feigning death.</p>

  <p><b>An´ode</b>, (Gr. <i>ana</i>, up, <i>hodos</i>, way), the positive
  pole of the voltaic current, being that part of the surface of a
  decomposing body which the electric current enters: opposed to
  <i>cathode</i> (Gr. <i>kata</i>, down, <i>hodos</i>, way), the way by
  which it departs.</p>

  <p><b>An´odon</b>, or <b>Anodon´ta</b>, a genus of <!-- Page 179 --><span

  bivalves, including the fresh-water mussels, without or with very slight
  hinge-teeth. See <i>Mussel</i>.</p>

  <p><b>An´odyne</b>, a medicine, such as an opiate or narcotic, which
  allays pain.</p>

  <p><b>Anointing</b>, rubbing the body or some part of it with oil, often
  perfumed. From time immemorial the nations of the East have been in the
  habit of anointing themselves for the sake of health and beauty. The
  Greeks and Romans anointed themselves after the bath. Wrestlers anointed
  themselves in order to render it more difficult for their antagonists to
  get hold of them. In Egypt it was common to anoint the head of guests
  when they entered the house where they were to be entertained. In the
  Mosaic law a sacred character was attached to the anointing of the
  garments of the priests, and things belonging to the ceremonial of
  worship. The Jewish priests and kings were anointed when inducted into
  office, and were called the <i>anointed of the Lord</i>, to show that
  their persons were sacred and their office from God. In the Old Testament
  also the prophecies respecting the Redeemer style him <i>Messias</i>,
  that is, the <i>Anointed</i>, which is also the meaning of his Greek name
  Christ. The custom of anointing still exists in the Roman Catholic Church
  in the ordination of priests and the confirmation of believers and the
  sacrament of extreme unction. The ceremony is also frequently a part of
  the coronation of kings.</p>

  <p><b>Anom´alure</b> (<i>Anomal&#x16B;rus</i>), a genus of rodent animals
  inhabiting the west coast of Africa, resembling the flying-squirrels, but
  having the under surface of the tail furnished for some distance from the
  root with a series of large horny scales, which, when pressed against the
  trunk of a tree, may subserve the same purpose as those instruments with

  <p><b>Anom´aly</b>, a deviation from the common rule. In astronomy, the
  angle which a line drawn from a planet to the sun has passed through
  since the planet was last at its perihelion or nearest distance to the
  sun. The <i>anomalistic year</i> is the interval between two successive
  times at which the earth is in perihelion, or 365 days 6 hours 13 minutes
  48 seconds. In consequence of the advance of the earth's perihelion among
  the stars in the same direction as the earth's motion, and of the
  precession of the equinoxes, which carries the equinoxes back in the
  opposite direction to the earth's motion, the anomalistic year is about 4
  minutes 40 seconds longer than the sidereal year, and about 25 minutes
  longer than the tropical or common year. The time of a complete
  revolution of the perihelion is computed at 108,000 years.</p>

  <p><b>Ano´na</b>, a genus of plants, the type of the nat. ord. Anonaceæ.
  <i>A. squam&#x14D;sa</i> (sweet-sop) grows in the West Indian Islands,
  and yields an edible fruit having a thick, sweet, luscious pulp. <i>A.
  muric&#x101;ta</i> (sour-sop) is cultivated in the West and East Indies;
  it produces a large pear-shaped fruit, of a greenish colour, containing
  an agreeable slightly-acid pulp. The genus produces other edible fruits,

  <p><b>Anoplothe´rium</b>, an extinct genus of the Ungulata or Hoofed
  Quadrupeds, forming the type of a distinct family, which were in many
  respects intermediate between the swine and the true ruminants. These
  animals were pig-like in form, but possessed long tails, and had a cleft
  hoof, with two rudimentary toes. Some of them were as small as a
  guinea-pig, others as large as an ass. Six incisors, two canines, eight
  premolars, and six molars existed in each jaw, the series being
  continuous, no interval existing in the jaw. <i>A. comm&#x16B;ne</i>,

  orientalist, born 1731, died 1805. He studied theology for some time, but
  soon devoted himself to the study of Hebrew, Arabic, and Persian. His
  zeal for the Oriental languages induced him to set out for India, where
  he prevailed on some of the Parsee priests to instruct him in the Zend
  and Pehlevi and to give him some of the Zoroastrian books. In 1762 he
  returned to France with a valuable collection of MSS. In 1771 he
  published his <i>Zend-Avesta</i>, a translation of the <i>Vendidad</i>,
  and other sacred books, which aroused much interest. Among his other
  works are <i>L'Inde en rapport avec l'Europe</i> (1790), and a selection
  from the <i>Vedas</i>. His knowledge of the Oriental languages was by no
  means exact.</p>

  <p><b>Ansbach.</b> See <i>Anspach</i>.</p>

  <p><b>An´selm</b>, St., a celebrated Christian philosopher and
  theologian, born at Aosta, in Piedmont, in 1033, died at Canterbury 1109.
  At the age of twenty-seven (1060) he became a monk at Bec, in Normandy,
  whither he had been attracted by the celebrity of Lanfranc. Three years
  later he was elected prior, and in 1078 he was chosen abbot, which he
  remained for fifteen years. During this period of his life he wrote his
  first philosophical and religious works: the dialogues on <i>Truth</i>
  and <i>Free-will</i>, and the treatises <i>Monologion</i> and
  <i>Proslogion</i>; and at the same time his influence made itself so felt
  among the monks under his charge that Bec became the chief seat of
  learning in Europe. In 1093 Anselm was offered by William Rufus the
  archbishopric of Canterbury, and accepted it, though with great
  reluctance, and with the condition that all the lands belonging to the
  see should be restored. William II soon quarrelled with the archbishop,
  who would show no subservience to him, and would persist in acknowledging
  Pope Urban II in opposition to the antipope Clement. William ultimately
  had to give way. He acknowledged Urban as Pope, and conferred the pallium
  upon Anselm. The king became his bitter enemy, however, and so great were
  Anselm's difficulties that in 1097 he set out for Rome to consult with
  the Pope. Urban received him with great distinction, but did not venture
  really to take the side of the prelate against the king, though William
  had refused to receive Anselm again as archbishop, and had seized on the
  revenues of the see of Canterbury, which he retained till his death in
  1100. Anselm accordingly remained abroad, where he wrote most of his
  celebrated treatise on the atonement, entitled <i>Cur Deus Homo</i>
  (<i>Why God was made Man</i>). When William was succeeded by Henry I
  Anselm was recalled; but Henry insisted that he should submit to be
  reinvested in his see by himself, although the Popes claimed the right of
  investing for themselves alone. Much negotiation followed, and Henry did
  not surrender his claims till 1107, when Anselm's long struggle on behalf
  of the rights of the Church came to an end. Anselm was a great scholar, a
  deep and original thinker, and a man of the utmost saintliness and piety.
  Anselm's great achievement in philosophy was his ontological argument for
  the existence of God; and his importance in the ecclesiastical history of
  England cannot be exaggerated. The chief of his writings are the
  <i>Monologion</i>, the <i>Proslogion</i>, and the <i>Cur Deus Homo</i>.
  The first is an attempt to prove inductively the existence of God by pure
  reason without the aid of Scripture or authority; the second is an
  attempt to prove the same by the deductive method; the <i>Cur Deus
  Homo</i> is intended to prove the necessity of the incarnation. Among his
  numerous other writings are more than 400 letters. His life was written
  by his domestic chaplain and companion, Eadmer, a monk of Canterbury, and
  is edited by M. Rule for the 'Rolls Series'. See <i>Scholasticism</i>.

  <p><b>An´son</b>, George, Lord, celebrated English navigator, born 1697,
  died 1762. He entered the navy at an early age and became a commander in
  1722, and captain in 1724. He was for a long time on the South Carolina
  station. In 1740 he was made commander of a fleet sent to the South Sea,
  directed against the trade and colonies of Spain. The expedition
  consisted of five men-of-war and three smaller vessels, which carried
  1400 men. After much suffering and many stirring adventures he reached
  the coast of Peru, made several prizes, and captured and burned the city
  of Paita. His squadron was now reduced to one ship, the <i>Centurion</i>,
  but with it he took the Spanish treasure galleon from Acapulco, and
  arrived in England in 1744 with treasure to the amount of £500,000,
  having circumnavigated the globe. His adventures and discoveries are
  described in the well-known <i>Anson's Voyage</i>, <!-- Page 181 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>[181]</span>compiled from materials
  furnished by Anson. A few days after his return he was made rear-admiral
  of the blue, and not long after rear-admiral of the white. His victory
  over the French admiral Jonquière, near Cape Finisterre in 1747, raised
  him to the peerage, with the title of Lord Anson, Baron of Soberton. Four
  years afterwards he was made First Lord of the Admiralty. In 1758 he
  commanded the fleet before Brest, protected the landing of the British at
  St. Malo, Cherbourg, &amp;c., and received the repulsed troops into his
  vessels. Finally, in 1761, he was appointed to convey the queen of George
  III to England.</p>

  temperate and tropical regions. They are small but powerful insects, and
  have long been noted for their remarkable intelligence and interesting
  habits. They are social insects, living in communities regulated by
  definite laws, each member of the society bearing a well-defined and
  separate part in the work of the colony. Each community consists of
  males; of females much larger than the males; and of barren females,
  otherwise called neuters, workers, or nurses. The neuters are wingless,
  and the males and females only acquire wings for their 'nuptial flight',
  after which the males perish, and the few females which escape the
  pursuit of their numerous enemies divest themselves of their wings, and
  either return to established nests, or become the foundresses of new
  colonies. The neuters perform all the labours of the ant-hill or abode of
  the community; they excavate the galleries, procure food, and feed the
  larvæ or young ants, which have not got organs of motion. In fine weather
  they carefully convey them to the surface for the benefit of the sun's
  heat, and as attentively carry them to a place of safety either when bad
  weather is threatened or the ant-hill is disturbed. In like manner they
  watch over the safety of the nymphs or pupæ about to acquire their
  perfect growth. Some communities possess a special type of neuters, known
  as 'soldiers', from the duties that specially fall upon them, and from
  their powerful biting jaws. There is a very considerable variety in the
  materials, size, and form of ant-hills, or nests, according to the
  peculiar nature or instinct of the species. Most of the British ants form
  nests in woods, fields, or gardens, their abodes being generally in the
  form of small mounds rising above the surface of the ground and
  containing numerous galleries and apartments. Some excavate nests in old
  tree-trunks. One little yellow ant (<i>Myrm&#x12B;ca domestica</i>) is
  common in houses in Britain in some localities. Some <!-- Page 182
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page182"></a>[182]</span>ants live on
  animal food, very quickly picking quite clean the skeleton of any dead
  animal they may light on. Others live on saccharine matter, being very
  fond of the sweet substance, called honey-dew, which exudes from the
  bodies of aphides, or plant-lice. These they sometimes keep in their
  nests, and sometimes tend on the plants where they feed; sometimes they
  even superintend their breeding. By stroking the aphides with their
  antennæ they cause them to emit the sweet fluid, which the ants then
  greedily sip up. Various other insects are looked after by ants in a
  similar manner, or are found in their nests. It has been observed that
  some species, like the European Red Ant (<i>Form&#x12B;ca
  sanguin&#x115;a</i>), resort to violence to obtain working ants of other
  species for their own use, plundering the nests of suitable kinds of
  their larvæ and pupæ, which they carry off to their own nests to be
  carefully reared and kept as slaves. In temperate countries male and
  female ants survive, at most, till autumn, or to the commencement of cool
  weather, though a very large proportion of them cease to exist long
  previous to that time. The neuters pass the winter in a state of torpor,
  and of course require no food. The only time when they require food is
  during the season of activity, when they have a vast number of young to
  feed. Some ants of Southern Europe feed on grain, and store it up in
  their nests for use when required. Some species have stings as weapons,
  others only their powerful mandibles, or an acrid and pungent fluid
  (formic acid) which they can emit. The name ant is also given to the
  neuropterous insects otherwise called Termites (q.v.). <span

  <p><b>Antarctic</b> (ant-ärk´tik), a term signifying the opposite of
  <i>Arctic</i>, and therefore relating to the southern pole or to the
  regions near it. The <i>Antarctic Circle</i>, which of course corresponds
  to the <i>Arctic Circle</i>, is a circle parallel to the equator and
  distant from the south pole 23° 28´, marking the area within which the
  sun does not set when on the tropic of Capricorn. The Antarctic Circle
  has been arbitrarily fixed on as the limits of the Antarctic Ocean, it
  being the average limit of the pack-ice; but the name is often extended
  to embrace a much wider area. The lands within or near the Antarctic
  Circle are but imperfectly known, and a very large area around the south
  pole is altogether unknown. The work of exploration has been hitherto
  baffled at various points by what seems an unsurmountable ice-barrier,
  which in some places is connected with masses of land and may as a whole
  belong to a great Antarctic continent. Among land-masses that have long
  been known to exist in the Antarctic Ocean, though our knowledge of them
  is very imperfect, are those to which have been attached the names Graham
  Land, Victoria Land, Wilkes Land, Enderby Land, South Shetland Islands,
  &amp;c. The Antarctic regions are even colder and more inhospitable than
  the Arctic, and partly on account of their remoteness from the maritime
  nations there have been far fewer efforts at their exploration, the south
  pole being far less a goal of discovery than the north. See <i>South
  Polar Expeditions</i>.</p>

    Ant-eater (<i>Myrmecoph&#x103;ga jub&#x101;ta</i>)
  </div>

  <p><b>Ant-eater</b>, a name given to mammals of various genera that prey
  chiefly on ants, but usually confined to the genus Myrmecoph&#x103;ga,
  ord. Edentata. In this genus the head is remarkably elongated, the jaws
  destitute of teeth, and the mouth furnished with a long, extensile <!--
  Page 183 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page183"></a>[183]</span>tongue covered with glutinous saliva, by
  the aid of which the animals secure their insect prey. The eyes are
  particularly small, the ears short and round, and the legs, especially
  the fore-legs, very strong, and furnished with long, compressed, acute
  nails, admirably adapted for breaking into the ant-hills. The most
  remarkable species is the <i>Myrmecoph&#x103;ga jub&#x101;ta</i>, or
  ant-bear, a native of the warmer parts of South America. It is from 4 to
  5 feet in length from the tip of the muzzle to the root of the black
  bushy tail, which is about 2 feet long. The body is covered with long
  hair, particularly along the neck and back. It is a harmless and solitary
  animal, and spends most of its time in sleep. Some are adapted for
  climbing trees in quest of the insects on which they feed, having
  prehensile tails. All are natives of South America. The name ant-eater is
  also given to the pangolins and to the aardvark. The echidna of Australia
  is sometimes called <i>porcupine ant-eater</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Antece´dent</b>, in grammar, the noun to which a relative or other
  pronoun refers; as, Solomon was the <i>prince who</i> built the temple,
  where the word <i>prince</i> is the antecedent of <i>who</i>.&mdash;In
  logic, that member of a hypothetical or conditional proposition which
  contains the condition, and which is introduced by <i>if</i> or some
  equivalent word or words; as, if the sun is fixed, the earth must move.
  Here the first and conditional proposition is the <i>antecedent</i>, the
  second the <i>consequent</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Antedilu´vian</b>, before the flood or deluge of Noah's time;
  relating to what happened before the deluge. In geology the term has been
  applied to organisms, traces of which are found in a fossil state in
  formations preceding the Diluvial (Glacial epoch), particularly to
  extinct animals such as the palæotherium, the mastodon, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>An´telope</b>, the name given to the members of a large family of
  Ruminant Ungulata or Hoofed Mammalia, closely resembling the Deer in
  general appearance, but essentially different in nature from the latter
  animals. They are included with the Sheep and Oxen in the family of the
  Cavicornia or 'Hollow-horned' Ruminants. Their horns, unlike those of the
  Deer, are not deciduous, but are permanent; are never branched, but are
  often twisted spirally, and may be borne by both sexes. They are found in
  greatest number and variety in Africa. Well-known species are the chamois
  (European), the gazelle, the addax, the eland, the koodoo, the gnu, the
  springbok, the sasin or Indian antelope, and the prongbuck of
  America.</p>

  <p><b>Anthol´ogy</b> (Gr. <i>anthos</i>, a flower, and <i>legein</i>, to
  gather), the name given to several collections of short poems which have
  come down from antiquity. The first to compile a Greek anthology was
  Meleager, a Syrian, about 60 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> He entitled
  his collection, which contained selections from forty-six poets besides
  many pieces of his own, the <i>Garland</i>; a continuation of this work
  by Philip of Thessalonica in the age of Tiberius was the first entitled
  <i>Anthology</i>. Later collections are that of Constantine Cephalas, in
  the tenth century, who made much use of the earlier ones, and that of
  Maximus Planudes, in the fourteenth century, a monk of Constantinople,
  whose anthology is a tasteless series of extracts from the
  <i>Anthology</i> of Cephalas, with some additions. The treasures
  contained in both, increased with fragments of the older poets, idylls of
  the bucolic poets, the hymns of Callimachus, epigrams from monuments and
  other works, have been published in modern times as the <i>Greek
  Anthology</i>. There is no ancient Latin anthology, the oldest being that

  professor in Columbia College, New York.</p>

  <p><b>An´thony</b>, St. the founder of monastic institutions, born near
  Heraclea, in Upper Egypt, <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 251. Giving up
  all his property he retired to the desert, where he was followed by a
  number of disciples, who thus formed the first community of monks. He
  died at the age of 105.&mdash;<i>St. Anthony's Fire</i>, a name given to
  erysipelas.</p>

  <p><b>An´thracene</b> (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>10</sub>) occurs in coal-tar
  in small quantity, about 0.25-0.45 per cent. During the distillation of
  tar a high-boiling fraction, boiling above 270° C., is obtained; this is
  crude anthracene oil, a greenish oily substance which, on further
  distillation, yields a crystalline mass, 50 per cent anthracene. This is
  carefully purified by distillation and chemical treatment to separate the
  anthracene from the other substances occurring with it, and the product
  obtained is finally purified by crystallization. When pure it forms
  colourless crystalline scales melting at 216° C., and having a violet
  fluorescence. It forms a series of derivatives, the most important being
  anthraquinone and alizarine and the numerous derivatives of these.
  Anthracene was originally a useless product in coal-tar distillation, but
  it became valuable as soon as it was discovered that alizarine&mdash;from
  which many dyes are manufactured directly or indirectly&mdash;could be
  prepared from it.</p>

  <p><b>An´thracite</b>, glance or blind coal, a non-bituminous coal of a
  shining lustre, approaching to metallic, and which burns without smoke,
  with a weak or no flame, and with intense heat. It consists of, on an
  average, 90 per cent carbon, 2 oxygen, 3 hydrogen, and 5 ashes. It has
  some of the properties of coal or charcoal, and, like that substance,
  represents an extreme alteration of vegetable substances by loss of
  gases, either during conditions of decay or after entombment among
  stratified rocks. It is found in England, <!-- Page 185 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>[185]</span>Scotland, and Ireland,
  and in large quantities in the United States (Pennsylvania), and near
  Swansea (South Wales). See <i>Coal</i>.</p>

  <p><b>An´thrax</b>, a fatal disease to which animals are subject, always
  associated with the presence of an extremely minute micro-organism
  (<i>Bacillus anthr&#x103;cis</i>) in the blood. It attacks cattle more
  frequently than other animals; sheep, horses, pigs, dogs, and fowls are
  liable to anthrax, but not cats. The mode of infection in animals is
  chiefly by ingestion. It may also be contracted through a wound or
  scratch in the skin, but this mode of infection is commoner in human
  beings than in animals. It frequently assumes an epizootic form, and
  extends over large districts, affecting all classes of animals which are
  exposed to the exciting causes. It is also called splenic fever, and is
  communicable to man, appearing as carbuncle, malignant pustule, or
  wool-sorter's disease.</p>

  <p><b>Anthropol´atry</b>, the worship of man, a word always employed in
  reproach; applied by the Apollinarians, who denied Christ's perfect
  humanity, towards the orthodox Christians.</p>

  <p><b>Anthro´polite</b>, a petrifaction of the human body or skeleton, or
  of parts of the body, by the encrusting action of calcareous waters, and
  hence hardly to be considered fossil or sub-fossil.</p>

  <p><b>Anthropol´ogy</b>, the science of man, including the study of man's
  place in nature, that is, of the measurement of his agreement with and
  divergence from other animals and the history of the emergence of human
  characteristics; of the distinctive features and geographical
  distribution of the races of mankind, their customs and beliefs; of the
  remains of extinct types of the human family and the evidence relating to
  their modes of life. It puts under contribution all sciences which have
  man for their object, as anatomy, palæontology, psychology, archæology,
  history, and comparative religion. All the races of mankind that are now
  living, much as they differ in external appearance, such as colour of
  skin, character of hair, form of skull, face, and body, and stature,
  belong to one species, <i>Homo Sapiens</i>; but an earlier species of
  more brutal type, <i>H. neanderthalensis</i>, now completely extinct, is
  known from fossil remains found in Germany, Belgium, France, Gibraltar,
  and Croatia. Three more ancient and primitive types, probably
  representing distinct genera of the human family, have been discovered
  respectively at Piltdown, in Sussex (Eoanthropus), at Mauer, near
  Heidelberg (Palæanthropus), and in Java, the Ape-man (Pithecanthropus).
  The Piltdown man may represent the very remote, but direct, ancestor of
  modern man; but the Heidelberg man and the Ape-man were probably
  divergent 'sports' whose descendants never became men of the modern
  type.</p>

  <p>In structure the gorilla reveals a close kinship with the human
  family, and was probably derived from a common ancestry which probably
  differentiated into man's forerunner and the gorilla's in Miocene times.
  Of existing races the aboriginal Australian is much the most primitive,
  and represents the survival of the earliest type of <i>Homo Sapiens</i>
  soon after this species became differentiated from men of the Neanderthal
  species. The negro, whose home is tropical Africa, is primitive in some
  respects, but in others is highly specialized. He is distinguished by his
  black skin, flat nose, prominent jaws and thick everted lips, and
  so-called 'woolly' or 'pepper-corn' hair. In stature he shows a wider
  range of variation than any other race, including, as he does, the
  tallest and the shortest varieties of mankind. The Bushman is a
  peculiarly distinct racial type now restricted to the deserts of South
  Africa. Though his skin is yellowish rather than black, he is akin to the
  negro. The Mongolian race probably assumed its distinctive features,
  yellowish skin, coarse black hair, and characteristic facial and bodily
  traits, in Eastern Asia; and the aboriginal population of America was
  sprung mainly from the less-specialized branch of this race. The
  so-called white races include three main stocks, a people of short
  stature, olive complexion, and long heads, the Mediterranean race; a
  taller people with fair hair and long heads, the Nordic race; and a
  short, thick-set, black-haired, broad-headed Alpine race, which made its
  way from Asia into Europe many centuries after the other two chief
  components of Europe's population. For long ages in every part of the
  world intermixture has been taking place in varying degrees between the
  different races of mankind, so that to-day probably no pure race exists.

  stature, weight, and complexion, existing in different districts of the
  British islands, are chiefly due to difference of racial origin.</p>

  <p><b>Anthropomor´phism</b>, the representation or conception of the
  Deity under a human form, or with human attributes and affections.
  <i>Anthropomorphism</i> is based upon the natural inaptitude of the human
  mind for conceiving spiritual things except through sensuous images, and
  in its consequent tendency to accept such expressions as those of
  Scripture when it speaks of the eye, the ear, and the hand of God, of his
  seeing and hearing, of his remembering and forgetting, of his making man
  in his own image, &amp;c., in a too literal sense. In a general sense
  anthropomorphism is the assumption of man that his own characteristics
  are present in beings or things widely different from himself, more
  particularly in forces of nature and gods. The term is, therefore, also
  applied to that doctrine which attributes to animals mental faculties of
  the same nature as those of man, though much lower in degree: strictly
  called <i>biological anthropomorphism</i>, to distinguish it from
  anthropomorphism proper, or <i>theological anthropomorphism</i>. Cf. E.
  Caird, <i>Evolution of Religion</i>; J.&nbsp;R. Illingworth, <i>Personality,
  Human and Divine</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Anthropoph´agi</b>, man-eaters, cannibals. Cannibalism was
  practised in very ancient times; and though some peoples, as the New
  Zealanders and Fijians, have given it up in recent times, it is still
  practised over a wide area in Central Africa, where human flesh is a
  common article of food. Superstitious ideas are often associated with
  cannibalism among those who practise it. The Caribs were cannibals at the
  time of the Spanish conquest, and the word 'cannibal' is derived from
  their name. See <i>Cannibalism</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Anti-aircraft guns</b> are guns so mounted that they may be pointed
  upward to fire directly against objects in the air. During the European
  War these guns, fitted with special appliances and ammunition, were used
  for defence against air-raids of the enemy, against Zeppelins and Gothas.
  The anti-aircraft guns are of various types, ranging from light
  machine-guns up to batteries of 3-inch and 6-inch guns. Some of them have
  brought down enemy machines flying at a height of 10,000 or 12,000
  feet.</p>

  <p><b>Anti-burgher Synod</b>, a section of the Scottish Secession Church,
  which held its first meeting in Edinburgh in the house of Adam Gib on
  10th April, 1747. It was formed in consequence of a breach resulting from
  a controversy respecting the religious clause of the oath taken by
  burgesses in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Perth. Those in favour of the oath
  were designated Burghers, whilst their opponents, who condemned the oath
  of the burgesses, became known as Anti-burghers. The union of the burgher
  and anti-burgher sections was brought about in 1820 through the exertions
  of John Jamieson, minister at the Anti-burgher Church in Nicholson
  Street, Edinburgh. See <i>United Free Church of Scotland</i>.</p>

  <p><b>An´tichlor</b>, the name given to any chemical substance, such as
  hyposulphite of sodium, employed to remove the small quantity of chlorine
  which obstinately adheres to the fibres of the cloth when goods are
  bleached by means of chlorine.</p>

  <p><b>An´tichrist</b>, a word occurring in the first and second
  <i>Epistles of St. John</i>, and nowhere else in Scripture, in passages
  having an evident reference to a personage real or symbolical mentioned
  or alluded to in various other passages both of the Old and New
  Testaments. The <i>idea itself</i>, however, of Antichrist can be traced
  back to the second century <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, and appears
  first of all in the <i>Book of Daniel</i>. In every age the Church has
  held through all its sects some definite expectation of a formidable
  adversary of truth and righteousness prefigured under this name. Thus
  Roman Catholics have found Antichrist in heresy, and Protestants in
  Romanism. In one point the sects have generally been agreed, namely, in
  regarding the various intimations on this subject in the Old and New
  Testaments as a homogeneous declaration or warning, inspired by the
  spirit of prophecy, of danger to the true <!-- Page 187 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page187"></a>[187]</span>religion from some
  disaffection and revolt organized in the latter days by Satan. Most
  modern critics take a different view of the matter. They do not regard
  the various Scriptural writers who have dealt with this subject as having
  had any common inspiration or design. They believe that each writer from
  his own point of view, guided by mere human sagacity, gives expression in
  his predictions to his own individual apprehensions, or narrates as
  prediction what he already knows. Originally Antichrist is nothing else
  than the incarnate devil, and the idea of the battle of God with a human
  opponent, endowed with devilish wickedness, arose under the influence of
  historical conditions. It is the near political horizon which suggests
  the danger, or contemporary history the substance of the prophecy; thus
  the Antichrist of Daniel is Antiochus Epiphanes, that of St. John Nero,
  that of St. Paul some adversary of Christianity about to appear in the
  time of the Emperor Claudius.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>:

  with great cold in winter and with great heat in summer.</p>

  <p><b>Anticyra</b> (an-tis'i-ra), the name of two towns of Greece, the
  one in Thessaly, the other in Phocis, famous for hellebore, which in
  ancient times was regarded as a specific against insanity and melancholy.

  <p><b>Anti-Federalists</b>, the political party in the United States
  which after the formation of the Federal constitution in 1787 opposed its
  ratification. Whilst the Federalists were striving to turn the federation
  into a united nation, and stood for a strong Government and centralizing
  tendencies, their opponents, the Anti-Federalists, either more
  democratic, or pretending that a strong Government meant a 'disguised'
  monarchic power, endeavoured to preserve a loose disintegrated
  federation. The Anti-Federalist party was gradually transformed into the
  Democratic-Republican party, led by Jefferson.</p>

  <p><b>Antifriction Metal</b>, a name given to various alloys of tin,

  <p><b>Antig´onus</b>, one of the generals of Alexander the Great, born
  about 382 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> In the division of the empire,
  after the death of Alexander, Antigonus obtained Greater Phrygia, Lycia,
  and Pamphylia as his dominion. But he soon managed to extend his power,
  being assisted by his warlike son, Demetrius Poliorc&#x113;t&#x113;s.
  Ptolemy, <!-- Page 188 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page188"></a>[188]</span>Seleucus, and Lysimachus, who had also
  been generals of Alexander, alarmed by his ambition, united themselves
  against him; and a long series of contests ensued in Syria,
  Ph&oelig;nicia, Asia Minor, and Greece, ending in 301 <span

  <p><b>Antigua</b> (an-t&#x113;´gwa), one of the British West Indies, the
  most important of the Leeward group; 28 miles long, 20 broad; area, 108
  sq. miles. Its shores are high and rocky, and much indented by creeks and
  inlets furnishing several good harbours. The surface is diversified by
  hill and dale, but nowhere rises to a greater height than 1500 feet. A
  considerable portion of it is fertile, and the climate is healthy, but
  there is a scarcity of water, there being no streams and few springs,
  droughts are not infrequent, and hurricanes are apt to cause serious loss
  and damage. Chief products are sugar, cotton, and pineapples. The island
  has fairly good shipping connections with the United Kingdom, the United
  States, and Canada. Antigua is governed as a crown colony, the Islands of
  Barbuda and Redonda being attached to it. The capital, St. John, the
  residence of the governor of the Leeward Islands, stands on the shore of
  a well-sheltered harbour in the north-west part of the island. Falmouth
  (English Harbour) in the south has also an excellent harbour with a
  dockyard. The island was discovered by Columbus in 1493; the first
  settlement was made by the English in 1632. Since then, except for a
  short period of occupation by the French, it has been a British
  possession. Pop. 32,269 (1911).</p>

  <p><b>Anti-Jac´obin</b>, a famous magazine (1797-1818), the original
  object of which was to satirize the Jacobin principles of the Fox section
  of Whigs; principal contributors: Gifford, Canning, Frere, and Ellis.</p>

  <p><b>Anti-Lebanon</b>, the eastern of the two parallel ranges known as
  the Mountains of Lebanon in Palestine. See <i>Lebanon</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Antilegom´ena</b> (things spoken against or objected to), a term
  applied by early Christian writers to the <i>Epistle to the Hebrews</i>,
  2 <i>Peter</i>, <i>James</i>, <i>Jude</i>, 2 and 3 <i>John</i>, and the
  <i>Apocalypse</i>, which, though read in the churches, were not for some
  time received into the canon of Scripture.</p>

  <p><b>Antilles</b> (an-til´&#x113;z), another name for the West Indian
  Islands (excluding Bahamas). See <i>West Indies</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Antilochus</b> (an-til´o-kus), in Greek legend, a son of Nestor,
  distinguished among the younger heroes who took part in the Trojan War by
  beauty, bravery, and swiftness of foot. He was slain by Memnon, but
  Achilles avenged his death.</p>

  <p><b>Antimacass´ar</b>, a covering for chairs, sofas, couches, &amp;c.,
  made of open cotton or worsted work, to preserve them from being soiled,
  as by the oil applied to the hair.</p>

  <p><b>Antimachus</b> (an-tim´a-kus), a Greek poet who lived about 400
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, and wrote an epic called the
  <i>Thebais</i> on the mythical history of Thebes, and a long elegy called
  <i>Lyd&#x113;</i>, inspired by a mistress or wife of that name. Both
  works were full of mythological details. Only fragments of his writings
  remain, and from these it can be gathered that his style was rather
  laboured and artificial. Yet the Alexandrian grammarians ranked him next
  to Homer.</p>

  <p><b>An´timony</b> (chemical symbol, Sb, from Lat. <i>stibium</i>; sp.
  gr. 6.7, atomic wt. 120.2), a brittle metal of a bluish-white or
  silver-white colour and a crystalline or laminated structure. It melts at
  630.6° C., and burns with a bluish-white flame. The mineral called
  stibnite or antimony-glance, is a tri-sulphide
  (Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>), and is the chief ore from which the metal
  is obtained. It is found in many places, including France, Spain,
  Hungary, Italy, Canada, Australia, and Borneo. The metal, or, as it was
  formerly called, the <i>regulus of antimony</i>, does not rust or tarnish
  when exposed to the air. When alloyed with other metals it hardens them,
  and is therefore used in the manufacture of alloys, such as
  Britannia-metal, type-metal, and pewter. In bells it renders the sound
  more clear; it renders tin more white and sonorous as well as harder, and
  gives to printing types more firmness and smoothness. The salts of
  antimony are very poisonous. The protoxide is the active base of tartar
  emetic and James's powder, and is justly regarded as a most valuable
  remedy in many diseases.&mdash;<i>Yellow antimony</i> is a preparation of
  antimony of a deep yellow colour, used in enamel and porcelain painting.
  It is of various tints, and the brilliancy of the brighter hues is not
  affected by foul air.</p>

  <p><b>Antino´mianism</b> ('opposition to the law'), the name given by
  Luther to the inference drawn by John Agricola (1492-1566), from the
  doctrine of justification by faith, that the moral law is not binding on
  Christians as a rule of life. The term antinomian has since been applied
  to all doctrines and practices which seem to contemn or discountenance
  strict moral obligations. The Lutherans and Calvinists have both been
  charged with antinomianism, the former on account of their doctrine of
  justification by faith, the latter both on this ground and that of the
  doctrine of predestination. The charge is, of course, vigorously repelled
  by both.</p>

  <p><b>Antin´omy</b>, the opposition of one law or rule <!-- Page 189
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page189"></a>[189]</span>to another law
  or rule; in the Kantian philosophy, that natural contradiction which
  results from the law of reason, when, passing the limits of experience,
  we seek to conceive the complex of external phenomena, or nature, as a
  world or cosmos.</p>

  <p><b>Antinous</b> (an-tin´o-us), a young Bithynian whom the extravagant
  love of Hadrian has immortalized. He drowned himself in the Nile in <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 122. Hadrian set no bounds to his grief for his
  loss. He gave his name to a newly-discovered star, erected temples in his
  honour, called a city after him, and caused him to be adored as a god
  throughout the empire. Statues, busts, &amp;c., of him are numerous.</p>

  <p><b>Antioch</b> (an´ti-ok), a town in Syria, famous in ancient times as
  the capital of the Greek Kings of Syria, on the left bank of the Orontes,
  about 21 miles from the sea, in a beautiful and fertile plain. It was
  founded by Seleucus Nicator in 300 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, and
  named after his father Antiochus. In Roman times it was the seat of the
  Syrian governors, and the centre of a widely-extended commerce. It was
  called the 'Queen of the East' and 'The Beautiful'. Antioch is frequently
  mentioned in the New Testament, and it was here that the disciples of our
  Saviour were first called Christians (<i>Acts</i>, xi, 26). In the first
  half of the seventh century it was taken by the Saracens, and in 1098 by
  the Crusaders. They established the principality of Antioch, of which the
  first ruler was Bohemond, and which lasted till 1268, when it was taken
  by the Mameluke Sultan of Egypt. In 1516 it passed into the hands of the
  Turks. The modern Antioch, or <i>Antakieh</i>, has recently grown from a
  small place to a flourishing town. Pop. estimated at 30,000.&mdash;There
  was another Antioch, in Pisidia, at which St. Paul preached on his first
  missionary journey.</p>

  <p><b>Antiochus</b> (an-t&#x12B;´o-kus), a name of several Græco-Syrian
  kings of the dynasty of the Seleuc&#x12D;dæ.&mdash;<b>Antiochus I,</b>
  called <i>S&#x14D;t&#x113;r</i> ('saviour'), was the son of Seleucus,
  general of Alexander the Great, and founder of the dynasty. He was born
  about 324 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, and succeeded his father in 280
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span> During the greater part of his reign he
  was engaged in a protracted struggle with the Gauls who had crossed from
  Europe, and by whom he was killed in battle, 261 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>&mdash;<b>Antiochus II</b>, surnamed <i>Theos</i>
  (god), succeeded his father, lost several provinces by revolt, and was
  murdered in 246 B.C. by Laodic&#x113;, his wife, whom he had put away to
  marry Beren&#x12B;c&#x113;, daughter of Ptolemy.&mdash;<b>Antiochus
  III</b>, surnamed the <i>Great</i>, grandson of the preceding, was born
  242 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, succeeded in 223 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> The early part of his reign embraced a series of
  wars against revolted provinces and neighbouring kingdoms, his
  expeditions extending to India, over Asia Minor, and afterwards into
  Europe, where he took possession of the Thracian Chersonese. Here he
  encountered the Romans, who had conquered Philip V of Macedon, and were
  prepared to resist his further progress. Antiochus gained an important
  adviser in Hannibal, who had fled for refuge to his Court; but he lost
  the opportunity of an invasion of Italy while the Romans were engaged in
  war with the Gauls, of which the Carthaginian urged him to avail himself.
  The Romans defeated him by sea and land, and he was finally overthrown by
  Scipio at Mount Sip&#x45E;lus, in Asia Minor, 190 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, and very severe terms were imposed upon him. He
  was killed while plundering a temple in Elymais to procure money to pay
  the Romans.&mdash;<b>Antiochus IV</b>, called <i>Epiph&#x103;nes,</i>
  youngest son of the above, is chiefly remarkable for his attempt to
  extirpate the Jewish religion, and to establish in its place the
  polytheism of the Greeks. This led to the insurrection of the Maccabees,
  by which the Jews ultimately recovered their independence. He died 164

  by a narrow strait, and has an area of 10 sq. miles, and about 700
  inhabitants.</p>

  <p><b>Antip´ater</b>, a general and friend of Philip of Macedon, father
  of Alexander the Great. On the death of Alexander, in 323 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, the regency of Macedonia was assigned to
  Antipater, who succeeded in establishing the Macedonian rule in Greece on
  a firm footing. He died 317 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, at an
  advanced age.</p>

  <p><b>Antip´athy</b>, a special dislike exhibited by individuals to
  particular objects or persons, usually resulting from physical or nervous
  organization. An antipathy is often an unaccountable repugnance to what
  people in general regard with no particular dislike, as certain sounds,
  smells, articles of food, &amp;c., and it may be manifested by fainting
  or extreme discomfort.</p>

  <p><b>Antiphlogis´tic</b>, a term applied to medicines or methods of

  <p><b>An´tiphon</b>, a Greek orator, born near Athens; founder of
  political oratory in Greece. His orations are the oldest extant, and he
  is said to have been the first who wrote speeches for hire. He was put to
  death for taking part in the revolution of 411 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, which established the oligarchic government of
  the Four Hundred. Antiphon seems to have specialized in homicide cases;
  his most celebrated speech is <i>On the Murder of Herodas</i>. Cf. Sir

  Orators</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Antiphon</b>, or <b>Antiph´ony</b> ('alternate song'), in the
  Christian Church a verse first sung by a single voice, and then repeated
  by the whole choir; or any piece to be sung by alternate voices.</p>

  <p><b>Antipodes</b> (an-tip´o-d&#x113;z), the name given relatively to
  people or places on opposite sides of the earth, so situated that a line
  drawn from one to the other passes through the centre of the earth and
  forms a true diameter. The longitudes of two such places differ by 180°.
  The difference in their time is about twelve hours, and their seasons are
  reversed.</p>

  <p><b>Antipodes Islands</b>, a group of small uninhabited islands in the
  South Pacific Ocean, about 460 miles <span class="scac">S.E.</span> by
  <span class="scac">E</span>. of New Zealand; so called from being nearly
  antipodal to Greenwich. Antipodes Island rises to 1300 feet, and is
  largely covered with coarse grass; huts have been fitted up to shelter
  castaways.</p>

  <p><b>An´tipope</b>, the name applied to those who at different periods
  have produced a schism in the Roman Catholic Church by opposing the
  authority of the Pope, under the pretence that they were themselves
  Popes. The Roman Church cannot admit that there ever existed two Popes;
  but the fact is, that in several cases the competitors for the papal
  chair were equally Popes; that is to say, the claims of all were equally
  good. Each was frequently supported by whole nations, and the schism was
  nothing but the struggle of political interests. Twenty-nine antipopes
  are enumerated in Church history; the last of them is Felix V,
  1439-49.</p>

  <p><b>Antipyret´ics</b>, medicines given for the purpose of reducing
  fever by lowering the patient's temperature, whether by causing
  perspiration or otherwise. Quinine, antipyrin, phenacetin, are common
  antipyretics. An aperient or purgative often serves the same purpose.</p>

  <p><b>Antipy´rin</b>, a drug obtained from coal-tar products, valuable in
  reducing fever and in relieving pain, being much used in nervous headache
  and neuralgia.</p>

  <p><b>An´tiquaries</b>, those devoted to the study of ancient times
  through their relics, as old places of burial, remains of ancient
  habitations, early monuments, implements or weapons, statues, coins,
  medals, paintings, inscriptions, books, and manuscripts, with the view of
  arriving at a knowledge of the relations, modes of living, habits, and
  general condition of the people who created or employed them. Societies
  or associations of antiquaries have been formed in all countries of
  European civilization. In Britain the Society of Antiquaries of London
  was founded in 1572, revived in 1717. and incorporated in 1751. The
  Society of Antiquaries of Scotland was founded in 1780, incorporated in
  1783, and has the management of a large national antiquarian museum in
  Edinburgh. One of the best-known antiquarian societies in Europe is the
  <i>Société Royale des Antiquaires du Nord</i> at Copenhagen.</p>

  <p><b>Antiques</b> (an-t&#x113;ks'), a term specifically applied to the
  remains of ancient art, as statues, paintings, vases, cameos, and the
  like, and more especially to the works of Grecian and Roman
  antiquity.</p>

  <p><b>Antirrhinum</b> (an-ti-r&#x12B;´num) (from <i>anti</i>, instead of,
  and <i>rhis</i>, snout), a genus of annual or perennial plants of the
  nat. ord. Scrophulariaceæ, commonly known as <i>snapdragon</i>, on
  account of the peculiarity of the blossoms, which, by pressing between
  the finger and thumb, may be made to open and shut like a mouth. They all
  produce showy flowers, and are much cultivated in gardens. Many varieties
  of some of them, such as the great or common snapdragon (<i>Antirrhinum
  majus</i>), have been produced by gardeners. The lesser snapdragon grows
  in sandy soil, and is found in cornfields in the south of England and
  Ireland.</p>

  <p><b>Antisana</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>n-t&#x113;-sä´na<span class="x1"><span

  miles <span class="scac">S.E.</span> by <span class="scac">E.</span> of
  Quito. Whymper, who ascended it in 1880, makes its height 19,260
  feet.</p>

  <p><b>Antis´cians</b> (Gr. <i>anti</i>, over against, <i>skia</i>, a
  shadow), those who live under the same meridian, at the same distance
  <span class="scac">N.</span> and <span class="scac">S.</span> of the
  equator, and whose shadows at noon consequently are thrown in contrary
  directions.</p>

  <p><b>Antiscorbu´tics</b>, remedies against scurvy. Lemon-juice, ripe
  fruit, milk, salts of potash, green vegetables, potatoes, fresh meat, and
  raw or lightly-boiled eggs, are some of the principal foodstuffs
  containing antiscorbutic vitamines.</p>

  <p><b>Anti-Sem´itism</b>, hostility to the Jews (Semites), actively
  exhibited in severities and attacks of various kinds. The movement
  assumed vast proportions about 1880 and manifested itself in various
  countries, especially Russia, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Roumania, and
  France. It may be attributed to different motives in different countries,
  but on the whole owed its origin not only to the fact of the Jews being a
  'peculiar people' by race and religion, but also to the comparatively
  high position won by them in modern times in the financial and political
  worlds. The religious element is quite <!-- Page 191 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page191"></a>[191]</span>prominent in the
  popular attacks on the Jew, although modern anti-Semitism is essentially
  social and economic. In Western Russia there was a great outburst against
  the Jews in 1881, in which men, women, and children were slaughtered. The
  Government of the Tsar, by its anti-Jewish policy, may be said to have
  sanctioned this murderous outbreak, which was followed by harsh laws and
  actual persecutions, though afterwards there was a mitigation of the
  severity shown towards the Jews. Yet in 1903 the world was startled by a
  terrible massacre of Jews at Kishinev, in Bessarabia, connived at by the
  authorities on the spot; and towards the end of 1905, in connection with
  the Russian revolutionary movement, there were dreadful massacres of Jews
  in Odessa, Kishinev, and other towns, the authorities being similarly
  involved. In Roumania, until 1919, the position of the Jews resembled
  what it was elsewhere in mediæval times, and was less favourable than it
  was even under the Turks. In Germany the movement has been worked chiefly
  by politicians for their own ends, though the racial and religious
  question has also had some influence; and among the ignorant the belief
  that the Jews murder Christian children for ritual purposes has been
  revived, as also in Austria and in Hungary. In these countries the
  movement has been partly political, partly social and economic, partly
  religious. In France anti-Semitism has been employed chiefly as a weapon
  by monarchists and clericals as against republicanism, and by the
  Socialists as against capitalism, racial antipathy having also its
  influence on the movements. It reached its height in 1895 at the time of
  the Dreyfus affair. In Britain, too, anti-Semitism has of late made
  itself felt.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: A.

  <p><b>Antisep´tic</b> (Gr. <i>anti</i>, against, and <i>s&#x113;pein</i>,
  to rot), an agent which destroys the germs of putrefaction or suppuration
  is called an antiseptic. Many substances act thus, e.g. chlorine, iodine,
  hypochlorous acid, sulphurous acid, camphor, creosote, iodoform, nascent
  oxygen ('Sanitas'), corrosive sublimate, formaldehyde ('Formalin'),
  potassium permanganate ('Condy's Fluid'), carbolic acid (Lysol, Izal,
  Cyllin); lately aniline dyes have become prominent: of these flavine has
  proved the most useful addition to surgery of recent years. It was much
  used in the European War (1914-8).&mdash;<i>Antiseptics</i> are also used
  for purifying surgical instruments, &amp;c., and commercially as
  disinfectants. When introduced by Lister into surgical practice they led
  to revolutionary advances in surgery. The tendency of late years has been
  to abandon antiseptic for aseptic (sterile) mode of technique, but during
  the war (1914-8) there was a general return to antiseptic methods in
  surgery.</p>

  <p><b>Antispasmod´ic</b>, a medicine for the cure of spasms and
  convulsions; such belong largely to the class of ethers, as sulphuric
  ether, chloric ether, nitric ether, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Antisthenes</b> (an-tis´the-n&#x113;z), a Greek philosopher and the
  founder of the school of Cynics, born at Athens about 444 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> He was first a disciple of Gorgias and then of
  Socrates, at whose death he was present. His philosophy was a one-sided
  development of the Socratic teaching. He held virtue to consist in
  complete self-denial and in disregard of riches, honour, or pleasure of
  every kind. He himself lived as a beggar. He died in Athens at an
  advanced age.</p>

  <p><b>Anti-Taurus</b>, a mountain range of Anatolia, Asia Minor,
  extending from the Cicilian Taurus towards the north-east, and connecting
  the Taurus mountain system with Mount Ararat, Mount Elbruz, and the
  Caucasus. See <i>Taurus</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Antith´esis</b> (opposition), a figure of speech consisting in a
  contrast or opposition of words or sentiments; as, 'When our vices
  <i>leave us</i>, we flatter ourselves we <i>leave them</i>'; 'The
  prodigal <i>robs his heir</i>, the miser <i>robs himself</i>'.</p>

  <p><b>Antitoxin</b>, the name given to a class of bodies of unknown
  nature having the capacity of neutralizing the poisonous substances
  (toxins) by which certain bacteria produce disease. If such a toxin be
  introduced every few days in increasing doses, into, e.g., the horse, and
  if, after some months of this treatment, the animal be bled, its serum
  contains the antitoxin to the toxins used. The use of the antitoxin to
  the toxin of diphtheria is most efficacious in curing that disease, and
  the treatment has caused a great fall in the death-rate. It ought to be
  applied as soon as possible after signs appear in the throat. An
  antitoxic treatment is also applicable in cases of tetanus (lock-jaw), a
  disease liable to follow any wound contaminated with dirt, especially
  with manured soil. Less success has been achieved when the disease is
  fully established, but if the antitoxin be injected immediately after the
  wound has been incurred, then the subsequent development of the disease
  is prevented. This preventive treatment has been attended with marked
  effect in the case of wounds received in war, which it is almost
  impossible to keep free from contamination. Antitoxins were extensively
  used during the European War. (1914-8). In bacterial diseases other than
  those mentioned, sera have been produced by injecting into large animals
  dead and living bacteria, e.g. the organisms of epidemic cerebro-spinal
  meningitis (spotted fever), pneumonia, blood-poisoning, &amp;c., and
  these sera probably depend <!-- Page 192 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page192"></a>[192]</span>for their action on the presence of bodies
  similar to antitoxins. See <i>Bacteria</i>, <i>Diphtheria</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Anti-trade Winds</b>, a name given to any of the upper tropical
  winds which move northward or southward in the same manner as the
  trade-winds which blow beneath them in the opposite direction. These
  great aerial currents descend to the surface after they have passed the
  limits of the trade-winds, and form the south-west or west-south-west
  winds of the north temperate, and the north-west or west-north-west winds
  of the south temperate zones.</p>

  <p><b>Antitrinita´rians</b>, all who do not receive the doctrine of the
  divine Trinity, or the existence of three persons in the Godhead;
  especially applied to those who oppose such a doctrine on philosophical
  grounds, as contrasted with Unitarians, who reject the doctrine as not
  warranted by Scripture.</p>

  <p><b>An´titype</b>, that which is correlative to a type; by theological
  writers the term is employed to denote the reality of which a <i>type</i>
  is the prophetic symbol.</p>

  <p><b>An´tium</b>, in ancient Italy, one of the most ancient and powerful
  cities of Latium, the chief city of the Volsci, and often at war with the
  Romans, by whom it was finally taken in 338 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> It was 38 miles distant from Rome, a flourishing

  <p><b>Ant-lion</b>, the larva of a Neuropterous insect
  (<i>Myrmel&#x115;on formic&#x101;rius</i>), which in its perfect state
  greatly resembles a dragon-fly; curious on account of its ingenious
  method of catching the insects&mdash;chiefly ants&mdash;on which it
  feeds. It digs a funnel-shaped hole in the driest and finest sand it can
  find, and when the pit is deep enough, and the sides are quite smooth and
  sloping, it buries itself at the bottom with only its formidable
  mandibles projecting, and waits till some luckless insect stumbles over
  the edge, when it is immediately seized, its juices sucked, and the dead
  body jerked out. It inhabits Southern Europe.</p>

  <p><b>Antofagas´ta</b>, a Chilian seaport on the Bay of Morena, and a

  <p><b>Antokolski</b>, Mark, Russian sculptor of Jewish extraction, born
  at Vilna in 1843. He studied at the Petrograd Academy of Fine Arts, and
  his earliest success was a wooden statue <i>The Jewish Tailor</i> (1864).
  In 1868 he received a grant for travelling, and whilst in Italy he
  finished his famous statue, <i>Ivan the Terrible</i>. He was made an
  academician, and in 1878 was awarded the first prize for sculpture at the
  Paris International Exhibition. In 1888 he settled permanently in Paris,
  where he died in 1902. His works include: <i>Peter the Great</i> (1872),
  <i>Christ before the People</i> (1874), <i>The Death of Socrates</i>
  (1876), <i>Spinoza</i> (1882), <i>Yermak</i> and <i>The Sleeping

  <p><b>Antommarchi</b> (-mär´k&#x113;), Carlo Francesco, Italian
  physician, born in Corsica in 1780, died in Cuba 1838. He was professor
  of anatomy at Florence when he offered himself as physician to Napoleon
  at St. Helena. Napoleon at first received him with reserve, but soon
  admitted him to his confidence, and testified his satisfaction with him
  by leaving him a legacy of 100,000 francs. On his return to Europe he
  published <i>Les Derniers Moments de Napoléon</i> (2 vols., 8vo,
  1823).</p>

  <p><b>Antonell´i</b>, Giacomo, cardinal, born 1806, died 1876. He was
  educated at the Grand Seminary of Rome, where he attracted the attention
  of Pope Gregory XVI, who appointed him to several important offices. On
  the accession of Pius IX in 1846 Antonelli was raised to the dignity of
  cardinal-deacon; two years later he became president and Minister of
  Foreign Affairs, and in 1850 was appointed Secretary of State. During the
  sitting of the &OElig;cumenical Council (1869-70) he was a prominent
  champion of the papal interest. He strongly opposed the assumption of the
  united Italian crown by Victor Emanuel.</p>

  Its western extremity was at or near Dunglass Castle, its eastern at
  Carriden, and the whole length of it exceeded 27 miles. It was

  wide and 20 feet deep, and a rampart of stone and earth on the south side
  24 feet thick and 20 feet in height. It was strengthened at either end
  and along its course by a series of forts and watch-towers. It may still
  be traced at various points, and is commonly known as <i>Graham's

  <p><b>Antoni´nus Pius</b>, Titus Aurelius Fulvus, Roman emperor, was born
  at Lavinium, near Rome, <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 86, died <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 161. In 120 <span class="scac">A.D.</span> he
  became consul, and he was one of the four persons of consular rank among
  whom Hadrian divided the supreme administration of Italy. He then went as
  proconsul to Asia, and after his return to Rome became more and more the
  object of Hadrian's confidence. In <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 138 he
  was selected by that emperor as his successor, and the same year he
  ascended the throne. He speedily put down the persecutions of the
  Christians, and carried on but a few wars. In Britain he extended the
  Roman dominion, and, by raising a new wall (see preceding article), put a
  stop to the invasions of the Picts and Scots. The senate gave him the
  surname <i>Pius</i>, that is, dutiful or showing filial affection,
  because to keep alive the memory of Hadrian he had built a temple in his
  honour. He was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius, his adopted son.</p>

  <p><b>Anto´nius</b>, Marcus (Mark Antony), Roman triumvir, born 83 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, was connected with the family of Cæsar by his
  mother. Debauchery and prodigality marked his youth. To escape his
  creditors he went to Greece in 58, and from thence followed the consul
  Gabinius on a campaign in Syria as commander of the cavalry. He served in
  Gaul under Cæsar in 52 and 51. In 50 he returned to Rome to support the
  interests of Cæsar against the aristocratical party headed by Pompey, and
  was appointed tribune. When war broke out between Cæsar and Pompey,
  Antony led reinforcements to Cæsar in Greece, and in the battle of
  Pharsalia he commanded the left wing. He afterwards returned to Rome with
  the appointment of Master of the Horse and Governor of Italy (47). In 44
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span> he became Cæsar's colleague in the
  consulship. Soon after Cæsar was assassinated, Antony, by the reading of
  Cæsar's will, and by the oration which he delivered over his body,
  excited the people to anger and revenge, and the murderers were obliged
  to flee. After several quarrels and reconciliations with Octavianus,
  Cæsar's heir (see <i>Augustus</i>), Antony departed to Cisalpine Gaul,
  which province had been conferred upon him against the will of the
  Senate. But Cicero thundered against him in his famous <i>Philippics</i>;
  the Senate declared him a public enemy, and entrusted the conduct of the
  war against him to Octavianus and the consuls Hirtius and Pansa. After a
  campaign of varied fortunes Antony fled with his troops over the Alps.
  Here he was joined by Lepidus, who commanded in Gaul, and through whose
  mediation Antony and Octavianus were again reconciled. It was agreed that
  the Roman world should be divided among the three conspirators, who were
  called <i>triumviri</i>. Antony was to take Gaul; Lepidus, Spain; and
  Octavianus, Africa and Sicily. They decided upon the proscription of
  their mutual enemies, each giving up his friends to the others, the most
  celebrated of the victims being Cicero the orator. Antony and Octavianus
  departed in 42 for Macedonia, where the united forces of their enemies,
  Brutus and Cassius, formed a powerful army, which was, however, speedily
  defeated at Philippi. Antony next visited Athens, and thence proceeded to
  Asia. In Cilicia he ordered Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, to apologize for
  her insolent behaviour to the <i>triumviri</i>. She appeared in person,
  and her charms fettered him for ever. He followed her to Alexandria,
  where he bestowed not even a thought upon the affairs of the world, till
  he was aroused by a report that hostilities had commenced in Italy
  between his own relatives and Octavianus. A short war, followed, which
  was decided in favour of Octavianus before the arrival of Antony in
  Italy. A reconciliation was effected, which was sealed by the marriage of
  Antony with Octavia, the sister of Octavianus. A new division of the
  Roman dominions was now made (in 40), by which Antony obtained the East,
  Octavianus the West. After his return to Asia Antony gave himself up
  entirely to Cleopatra, assuming the style of an Eastern despot, and so
  alienating many of his adherents and embittering public opinion against
  him at Rome. At length war was declared at Rome against the Queen of
  Egypt, and Antony was deprived of his consulship and government. Each
  party assembled its forces, and Antony lost, in the naval battle at
  Actium, 31 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, the dominion of the world. He
  followed Cleopatra to Alexandria, and on the arrival of Octavianus his
  fleet and cavalry deserted, and his infantry was defeated. Deceived by a
  false report of her death which Cleopatra had disseminated, he fell upon
  his own sword (30 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>).&mdash;<span

  <p><b>An´trim</b>, a county of Ireland, province of Ulster, in the
  north-east of the island; area, 702,654 acres, of which about a third are
  arable. The eastern and northern districts are comparatively mountainous,
  with tracts of heath and bog, but no part rises to a great height. The
  principal rivers are the Lagan and the Bann, which separate Antrim from
  Down and Londonderry respectively. The general soil of the plains and
  valleys is strong loam. Flax, oats, and potatoes are the principal
  agricultural produce. Cattle, sheep, swine, and goats are extensively
  reared. There are salt-mines and beds of iron-ore, which is worked and
  exported. A range of basaltic strata stretches along the northern coast,
  of which the celebrated Giant's Causeway is the most remarkable portion,
  the vast aggregates of natural rock pillars there being very striking.
  The interior also contains some scenes of picturesque beauty,
  particularly the fertile valley of the Lagan, between Belfast and
  Lisburn. Much of the scenery of the county, however, is dreary and
  monotonous. Lough Neagh, the largest lake of the United Kingdom, is
  principally in Antrim. Its waters are carried to the sea by the Bann,
  which is of no use for navigation, being obstructed by weirs and rocks.
  The spinning of linen and cotton yarn, and the weaving of linen and
  cotton, are the staple manufactures, but the cotton manufacture is small
  compared with that of linen. The principal towns are Belfast, Lisburn,
  Ballymena, Larne, and Carrickfergus. In 1898 Belfast, the former capital,
  was constituted into a county borough. About fifty per cent of the
  inhabitants are Presbyterians, being the descendants of Scottish
  immigrants of the seventeenth century. The county sends four members to
  Parliament; Belfast returns nine. Pop. (excluding Belfast) 193,864
  (1911).&mdash;The town of Antrim, at the north end of Lough Neagh, is a
  small place with a pop. of 1826.</p>

  <p><b>Ant-thrush</b>, a name given to certain passerine or perching birds
  having resemblances to the thrushes and supposed to feed largely on ants.
  They all have longish legs, short wings, and a short tail. The true
  ant-thrushes of the Old World belong to the genus Pitta. They chiefly
  inhabit southern and south-eastern Asia and the Eastern Archipelago, but
  are also found in Africa and Australia, and are birds of brilliant
  plumage, exhibiting black, white, scarlet, blue, and green in vivid
  contrast, there being generally no blending of colours by means of
  intermediate hues. These birds are not now regarded as allied to the
  thrushes, nor are they allied to the ant-birds, or ant-thrushes of the
  New World, which live among close foliage and bushes. Some of these are
  called ant-shrikes and ant-wrens. They belong to several genera.</p>

  <p><b>Ant´werp</b> (Du. and Ger. <i>Antwerpen</i>, Fr. <i>Anvers</i>),
  the chief port of Belgium, and one of the first on the Continent, the
  capital of a province of the same name, on the Scheldt, about 50 miles
  from the open sea. It lies in a fertile plain at an abrupt turn of the
  river, which is here from 160 to 280 yards wide, and has a depth varying
  from 25 to 50 feet. It is strongly fortified, being completely surrounded
  on the land side by a semicircular inner line of fortifications, the
  defences being completed by an outer line of forts and outworks. Fine
  quays have been constructed along the river banks. The general appearance
  of the city is exceedingly picturesque, an effect produced by the
  numerous churches, convents, and magnificent public buildings, the
  stately antique houses that line its older thoroughfares, and the
  profusion of beautiful trees with which it is adorned. The older streets
  are tortuous and irregular, but those in the newer quarters are wide and
  regular. Some of the squares are very handsome. The cathedral, with a
  spire 400 feet high, one of the largest and most beautiful specimens of
  Gothic architecture in Belgium, contains Rubens' celebrated masterpieces,
  <i>The Descent from the Cross</i>, <i>The Elevation of the Cross</i>, and
  <i>The Assumption</i>. The other churches of note are St. James's, St.
  Andrew's, and St. Paul's, all enriched with paintings by Rubens, Vandyck,
  and other masters. Among the other buildings of note are the exchange,
  the town hall, the palace, the theatre, academy of the fine arts, picture
  and sculpture galleries, &amp;c. The harbour accommodation is extensive
  and excellent, large new docks and quays having been recently built, and
  other works being under construction or contemplated. The shipping trade
  is now very large, Antwerp being a great centre of the world's commerce,
  and the goods being largely in transit. The entries of vessels in a year
  aggregate over 13,000,000 tons. Much of the trade is with Britain. There
  are numerous but not very important industries. Antwerp is mentioned as
  early as the eighth century, and in the eleventh and twelfth it had
  attained a high degree of prosperity. In the sixteenth century it is said
  to have had a pop. of 200,000, and it had then an extensive foreign
  trade. The wars between the Netherlands and Spain greatly injured its
  commerce, which was almost ruined by the closing of the navigation of the
  Scheldt in accordance with the peace of Westphalia (1648). It was only in
  the nineteenth century that its prosperity revived. In the European War
  <!-- Page 195 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page195"></a>[195]</span>(1914-8), the Germans, under General von
  Beseler, entered Antwerp on 7th Oct., 1914, and remained there until
  Nov., 1918. Pop. (1919), 322,857.&mdash;The province consists of a
  fertile plain 1093 sq. miles in area, and has a pop. of over
  1,000,000.</p>

  for the reception of a set or chisel to cut off pieces of iron; and the
  beak or conical end, used for turning pieces of iron into a circular
  form, &amp;c. These pieces are each separately welded to the core and
  hammered so as to form a regular surface with the whole. When the anvil
  has received its due form, it is faced with steel, and is then tempered
  in cold water. The smith's anvil is generally placed loose upon a wooden
  block. The anvil for heavy operations, such as the forging of ordnance
  and shafting, consists of a huge iron block deeply embedded, and resting
  on piles of masonry.</p>

  the top of the breast-bone, when it is called the <i>ascending aorta</i>;
  then makes a great curve, called the transverse or <i>great arch of the
  aorta</i>, whence it branches off to the head and upper extremities;
  thence proceeding towards the lower extremities, under the name of the
  <i>descending aorta</i>, it branches off to the trunk; and finally
  divides into the two iliacs, which supply the pelvis and lower
  extremities.</p>

  amphitheatre, &amp;c. Pop. 7000.</p>

  <p><b>Aoudad</b> (a-ö´dad), the <i>Ammotr&#x103;gus
  tragel&#x103;phus</i>, a quadruped allied to the sheep, most closely to
  the mouflon, from which, however, it may be easily distinguished by the
  heavy mane, commencing at the throat and falling as far as the knees. It
  is a native of North Africa, inhabiting the loftiest and most
  inaccessible rocks.</p>

  <p><b>Apaches</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>-pä´chez), a warlike race of
  North-American Indians, numbering between 5000 and 6000, and inhabiting
  Arizona, New Mexico, and <!-- Page 196 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page196"></a>[196]</span>Oklahoma. The final surrender of the tribe
  took place in 1886, but a few in Mexico still maintain their independence
  and hostility to the whites. The name <i>Apache</i> was assumed by
  Parisian hooligans, notorious for their criminal outrages.</p>

  <p><b>Ap´anage</b>, an allowance which the younger princes of a reigning
  house in some European countries receive from the revenues of the
  country, generally together with a grant of public domains, that they may
  be enabled to live in a manner becoming their rank.</p>

  <p><b>Ap´atite</b>, a translucent but seldom transparent mineral, which
  crystallizes in a regular six-sided prism, usually terminated by a
  truncated six-sided pyramid. It passes through various shades of colour,
  from white to yellow, green, blue, and occasionally red, scratches
  fluor-spar but is scratched by felspar, and has a specific gravity of
  about 3.5. It is a compound of calcium phosphate with calcium fluoride or
  chloride. It occurs principally in igneous rocks, particularly diorites.
  The very coarse-grained granites of Ontario contain apatite crystals of
  corresponding size, which have been picked out as a source of artificial
  phosphate manures. Apatite supplies to soils almost all the phosphorus
  available for plants in a state of nature.</p>

  <p><b>Ape</b>, a common name of a number of quadrumanous animals
  inhabiting the Old World (Asia and the Asiatic Islands, and Africa), and
  including a variety of species. The word <i>ape</i> was formerly applied
  indiscriminately to all quadrumanous mammals; but it is now limited to
  the anthropoid or man-like monkeys. The family includes the chimpanzee,
  gorilla, orang-outang, &amp;c., and has been divided into three genera,
  Troglod&#x45E;tes, Simia, and Hylob&#x103;tes. See <i>Chimpanzee</i>,
  <i>Gibbon</i>, <i>Gorilla</i>, <i>Monkey</i>, <i>Orang</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Apeldoorn</b> (ä´pel-d&#x14D;rn), a town of Holland, province of
  Guelderland, 17 miles north of Arnhem, with manufactures of paper. The
  royal palace Loo is here. Pop. 44,474.</p>

  <p><b>Apelles</b> (a-pel´&#x113;z), the most famous of the painters of
  ancient Greece and of antiquity, was born in the fourth century <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, probably at Colophon. Ephorus of Ephesus was
  his first teacher, but attracted by the renown of the Sicyonian school he
  went and studied at Sicyon. In the time of Philip he went to Macedonia,
  and there a close friendship between him and Alexander the Great was
  established. The most admired of his pictures was that of Venus rising
  from the sea and wringing the water from her dripping locks. His portrait
  of Alexander with a thunderbolt in his hand was no less celebrated. He
  died about the end of the century. Among the anecdotes told of Apelles is
  the one which gave rise to the Latin proverb, 'Ne sutor ultra
  crepidam'&mdash;'Let not the shoemaker go beyond the shoe'. Having heard
  a cobbler point out an error in the drawing of a shoe in one of his
  pictures he corrected it, whereupon the cobbler took upon him to
  criticize the leg, and received from the artist the famous reply.</p>

  <p><b>Ap´ennines</b> (Lat. <i>Mons Apenninus</i>), a prolongation of the
  Alps, forming the 'backbone of Italy'. Beginning at Savona, on the Gulf
  of Genoa, the Apennines traverse the whole of the peninsula and also
  cross over into Sicily, the Strait of Messina being regarded merely as a
  gap in the chain. The average height of the mountains composing the range
  is about 4000 feet, and nowhere do they reach the limits of perpetual
  snow, though some summits exceed 9000 feet in height. Monte Corno, called
  also Gran Sasso d'Italia (Great Rock of Italy), which rises among the
  mountains of the Abruzzi, is the loftiest of the chain, rising to the
  height of 9541 feet, Monte Majella (9151) being next. Monte Gargano,
  which juts out into the Adriatic from the <i>ankle</i> of Italy, is a
  mountainous mass upwards of 5000 feet high, completely separated from the
  main chain. On the Adriatic side the mountains descend more abruptly to
  the sea than on the western or Mediterranean side, and the streams are
  comparatively short and rapid. On the western side are the valleys of the
  Arno, Tiber, Garigliano, and Volturno, the largest rivers that rise in
  the Apennines, and the only ones of importance in the peninsular portion
  of Italy. They consist almost entirely of limestone rocks, and are
  exceedingly rich in the finest marbles. On the south slopes volcanic
  masses are not uncommon. Mount Vesuvius, the only active volcano on the
  continent of Europe, is an instance. The lower slopes are well clothed
  with vegetation, the summits are sterile and bare.</p>

  <p><b>Apenrade</b> (ä´pen-rä-de), a seaport in Schleswig-Holstein, on a
  fiord of the Little Belt, beautifully situated, and carrying on a
  considerable fishing industry. Pop. 7800.</p>

  <p><b>Ape´rient</b>, a medicine which, in moderate doses, gently but
  completely opens the bowels: examples, castor-oil, Epsom salts, senna,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Apet´alous</b>, a botanical term applied to flowers or
  flowering-plants which are destitute of petals or corolla.</p>

  <p><b>Aphanip´tera</b>, an order of wingless insects, composed of the
  different species of fleas. See <i>Flea</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Apha´sia</b> (Gr. <i>a</i>, not, and <i>phasis</i>, speaking), in
  pathology, a symptom of certain morbid conditions of the nervous system,
  in which the patient loses the power of expressing ideas by means of
  words, or loses the appropriate use of words, the vocal organs the while
  remaining intact and the intelligence sound. There is sometimes an entire
  loss of words as connected with ideas, and sometimes only the loss of a
  few. In one form of the disease, called <i>aphemia</i>, the <!-- Page 197
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"></a>[197]</span>patient can
  think and write, but cannot speak; in another, called <i>agraphia</i>, he
  can think and speak, but cannot express his ideas in writing. In a great
  majority of cases, where post-mortem examinations have been made, morbid
  changes have been found in the left frontal convolution of the brain.</p>

  <p><b>Aphe´lion</b> (Gr. <i>apo</i>, from, and <i>h&#x113;lios</i>, the

  <p><b>Aphis</b>, a genus of insects (called plant-lice) of the ord.
  Hemiptera, the type of the family Aph&#x12D;d&#x113;s. The species are
  very numerous and destructive. The <i>A. rosæ</i> lives on the rose; the
  <i>A. fabæ</i> on the bean; the <i>A. hum&#x16D;li</i> is injurious to
  the hop, the <i>A. granaria</i> to cereals, and <i>A. lanig&#x115;ra</i>
  or woolly aphis equally so to apple trees. The aphides are furnished with
  an inflected beak, and feelers longer than the thorax. In the same
  species some individuals have four erect wings and others are entirely
  without wings. The feet are of the ambulatory kind, and the abdomen
  usually ends in two horn-like tubes, from which is ejected the substance
  called honey-dew, a favourite food of ants. (See <i>Ant</i>.) The aphides
  illustrate parthenogenesis; hermaphrodite forms produced from eggs
  produce viviparous wingless forms, which again produce others like
  themselves, and thus multiply during summer, one individual giving rise
  to millions. Winged sexual forms appear late in autumn, the females of
  which, being impregnated by the males, produce eggs.</p>

  <p><b>Apho´nia</b> (Gr. <i>a</i>, not, and <i>ph&#x14D;n&#x113;</i>,
  voice), in pathology, the greater or less impairment, or the complete
  loss of the power of emitting vocal sound. The slighter and less
  permanent forms often arise from extreme nervousness, fright, and
  hysteria. Slight forms of structural aphonia are of a catarrhal nature,
  resulting from more or less congestion and tumefaction of the mucous and
  submucous tissues of the larynx and adjoining parts. Severer cases are
  frequently occasioned by serous infiltration into the submucous tissue,
  with or without inflammation of the mucous membrane of the larynx and of
  its vicinity. The voice may also be affected in different degrees by
  inflammatory affections of the fauces and tonsils; by tumours in these
  situations; by morbid growths pressing on or implicating the larynx or
  trachea; by aneurisms; and most frequently by chronic laryngitis and its
  consequences, especially thickening, ulceration, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Aph´orism</b>, a brief, sententious saying, in which a
  comprehensive meaning is involved, as 'Familiarity breeds contempt';
  'Necessity has no law'.</p>

  <p><b>Aphrodite</b> (af-ro-di´t&#x113;), the goddess of love among the
  Greeks; counterpart of the Roman Venus. A festival called Aphrodisia was
  celebrated in her honour in various parts of Greece, but especially in
  Cyprus. See <i>Venus</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Aphthæ</b> (af´th&#x113;), a disease occurring especially in
  infants, but occasionally seen in old persons, and consisting of small
  white ulcers upon the tongue, gums, inside of the lips, and palate,
  resembling particles of curdled milk: commonly called <i>thrush</i> or
  <i>milk-thrush</i>.</p>

  <p><b>A´pia</b>, the chief place and trading centre of the Samoa Islands,
  on the north side of the Island of Upolu. It has a wireless station.</p>

  <p><b>A´piary</b> (Lat. <i>apis</i>, a bee), a place for keeping bees.
  The apiary should be well sheltered from strong winds, moisture, and the
  extremes of heat and cold. The hives should face the south or south-east,
  and should be placed on shelves 2 feet above the ground, and about the
  same distance from each other. There is no place for handling bees like
  the open air in suitable weather, and for this reason bee-houses, or
  bee-sheds, formerly in use, are not much in vogue now. As to the form of
  the hives and the materials of which they should be constructed there are
  great differences of opinion. The old dome-shaped straw <i>skep</i> is
  still in general use among the cottagers of Great Britain. Its cheapness
  and simplicity of construction are in its favour, while it is excellent
  for warmth and ventilation; but it has the disadvantage that its interior
  is closed to inspection, and the honey can only be got out by stupefying
  the bees with the smoke of the common puff-ball or chloroform, or by
  fumigating with sulphur, which entails the destruction of the swarm.
  Wooden hives of square box-like form are now gaining general favour among
  bee-keepers. They usually consist of a large breeding chamber below and
  two sliding removable boxes called 'supers' above for the abstraction of
  honey without disturbing the contents of the main chamber. It is of great
  importance that the apiary should be situated in the neighbourhood of
  good feeding <!-- Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page198"></a>[198]</span>grounds, such as gardens, clover-fields,
  or heath-covered hills. When their stores of honey are removed, the bees
  must be fed during the winter and part of spring with syrup or with a
  solution consisting of 2 lb. loaf-sugar to a pint of water. In the early
  spring slow and continuous feeding (a few ounces of syrup each day) will
  stimulate the queen to deposit her eggs, by which means the colony is
  rapidly strengthened and throws off early swarms. New swarms may make
  their appearance as early as May and as late as August, but swarming
  usually takes place in the intervening months. See <i>Bee-keeping</i>,
  <i>Hives</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Apic´ius</b>, Marcus Gabius, a Roman epicure in the time of
  Augustus and Tiberius, who, having exhausted his vast fortune on the
  gratification of his palate, and having <i>only</i> about £80,000 left,
  poisoned himself that he might escape the misery of plain diet. The book
  of cookery published under the title of <i>Apicius</i> was written by one
  Cælius, and belongs to a much later date.</p>

  <p><b>A´pion</b>, a Greek grammarian, born in Egypt, lived in the reigns
  of Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius, <span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  15-54, and went to Rome to teach grammar and rhetoric. Among his works,
  one or two fragments only of which remain, was one directed against the
  Jews, which was replied to by Josephus.</p>

  <p><b>A´pios</b>, a genus of leguminous climbing plants, producing edible
  tubers on underground shoots. An American species (<i>A.
  tuber&#x14D;sa</i>) has been used as a substitute for the potato, but its
  tubers, though numerous, are small.</p>

  <p><b>A´pis</b>, a bull to which divine honours were paid by the ancient
  Egyptians, who regarded him as a symbol of Osiris. At Memphis he had a
  splendid residence, containing extensive walks and courts for his
  entertainment, and he was waited upon by a large train of priests, who
  looked upon his every movement as oracular. He was not suffered to live
  beyond twenty-five years, being secretly killed by the priests and thrown
  into a sacred well. Another bull, characterized by certain marks, as a
  black colour, a triangle of white on the forehead, a white
  crescent-shaped spot on the right side, &amp;c., was selected in his
  place. His birthday was annually celebrated, and his death was a season
  of public mourning. See <i>Animal Worship</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Apoc´alypse</b> (Gr. <i>apokalypsis</i>, a revelation), the name
  given to the last book of the New Testament, in the English version
  called <i>The Revelation of St. John the Divine</i>. Although a Christian
  work, the <i>Apocalypse</i> belongs to a class of literature dealing with
  eschatological subjects and much in vogue among the Jews of the first
  century <span class="scac">B.C.</span> It is generally believed that the
  <i>Apocalypse</i> was written by the apostle John in his old age (<span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 95-97) in the Isle of Patmos, whither he had
  been banished by the Roman Emperor Domitian. Anciently its genuineness
  was maintained by Justin Martyr, Irenæus, Clement of Alexandria,
  Tertullian, and many others; while it was doubted by Dionysius of
  Alexandria, Cyril of Jerusalem, Chrysostom, and, nearer our own times, by
  Luther. The <i>Apocalypse</i> has been explained differently by almost
  every writer who has ventured to interpret it, and has furnished all
  sorts of sects and fanatics with quotations to support their creeds or
  pretensions. The modern interpreters may be divided into three
  schools&mdash;namely, the <i>historical school</i>, who hold that the
  prophecy embraces the whole history of the Church and its foes from the
  time of its writing to the end of the world; the <i>Præterists</i>, who
  hold that the whole or nearly the whole of the prophecy has been already
  fulfilled, and that it refers chiefly to the triumph of Christianity over
  Paganism and Judaism; and the <i>Futurists</i>, who throw the whole
  prophecy, except the first three chapters, forward upon a time not yet
  reached by the Church&mdash;a period of no very long duration, which is
  immediately to precede Christ's second coming. See
  <i>Bible</i>.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: R.&nbsp;H. Charles,

  Apocalypses</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Apocalyptic Number</b>, the mystic number 666 found in <i>Rev.</i>
  xiii, 18. As early as the second century ecclesiastical writers found
  that the name Antichrist was indicated by the Greek characters expressive
  of this number. By Irenæus the word <i>Lateinos</i> was found in the
  letters of the number, and the Roman Empire was therefore considered to
  be Antichrist. Protestants generally believe it has reference to the
  Papacy, and, on the other hand, Catholics connect it with Protestantism.
  It is, however, almost certain that the number <!-- Page 199 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page199"></a>[199]</span>refers to Nero, for by
  transliterating the Greek <i>Kaisar Neron</i> into Hebrew, and adding
  together the sums denoted by the Hebrew letters, we obtain the number
  666.</p>

  <p><b>Apocar´pous</b>, in botany, a term applied to such fruits as are
  the produce of a single flower, and are formed of one carpel, or a number
  of carpels free and separate from each other.</p>

  <p><b>Apoc´rypha</b> (Gr., 'things concealed or spurious'), a term
  applied in the earliest churches to various sacred or professedly
  inspired writings, sometimes given to those whose authors were unknown,
  sometimes to those with a hidden meaning, and sometimes to those
  considered objectionable. The term is specially applied to the fourteen
  undermentioned books, which were written during the two centuries
  preceding the birth of Christ. They were written, not in Hebrew, but in
  Greek, and the Jews never allowed them a place in their sacred canon.
  They were incorporated into the Septuagint, and thence passed to the
  Vulgate. The Greek Church excluded them from the canon in 360 at the
  Council of Laodicea. The Latin Church treated them with more favour, but
  it was not until 1546 that they were formally admitted into the canon of
  the Church of Rome by a decree of the Council of Trent. The Anglican
  Church says they may be read for example of life and instruction of
  manners, but that the Church does not apply them to establish any
  doctrine. All other Protestant churches in Britain and America ignore
  them. The following fourteen books form the Apocrypha of the English
  Bible: The first and second <i>Books of Esdras</i>, <i>Tobit</i>,
  <i>Judith</i>, the rest of the <i>Book of Esther</i>, the <i>Wisdom of
  Solomon</i>, the <i>Wisdom of Jesus the son of Sirach</i>, or
  <i>Ecclesiasticus</i>, <i>Baruch the Prophet</i>, the <i>Song of the
  Three Children</i>, <i>Susanna and the Elders</i>, <i>Bel and the
  Dragon</i>, the <i>Prayer of Manasses</i>, and the first and second
  <i>Books of Maccabees</i>. Besides the Apocryphal books of the Old
  Testament there are many spurious books composed in the earlier ages of
  Christianity, and published under the names of Christ and his apostles,
  or of such immediate followers as from their character or means of
  intimate knowledge might give an apparent plausibility to such forgeries.
  These writings comprise: 1st, the <i>Apocryphal Gospels</i>, which treat
  of the history of Joseph and the Virgin before the birth of Christ, of
  the infancy of Jesus, and of the acts of Pilate; 2nd, the <i>Apocryphal
  Acts of the Apostles</i>; and 3rd, the <i>Apocryphal Apocalypses</i>,
  none of which have obtained canonical recognition by any of the
  churches.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: Wace, <i>The

  <p><b>Apocyna´ceæ</b>, a nat. ord. of dicotyledonous plants, having for
  its type the genus Apoc&#x45E;num or dog-bane. The species have opposite
  or sometimes whorled leaves without stipules; the corolla monopetalous,
  hypogynous, and with the stamens inserted upon it; fruit two-celled. The
  plants yield a milky juice, which is generally poisonous; several yield
  caoutchouc, and a few edible fruits. The bark of several species is a
  powerful febrifuge. To the order belongs the periwinkle (Vinca). See

  <p><b>Apo´dösis</b>, in grammar, the latter member of a conditional
  sentence (or one beginning with <i>if</i>, <i>though</i>, &amp;c.)
  dependent on the condition or <i>prot&#x103;sis</i>; as, if it rain
  (<i>protasis</i>) I shall not go (<i>apodosis</i>).</p>

  <p><b>Ap´ogee</b> (-j&#x113;; Gr. <i>apo</i>, from, and <i>g&#x113;</i>,
  the earth), that point in the orbit of the moon or a planet where it is
  at its greatest distance from the earth; also the greatest distance of
  the sun from the earth when the latter is in <i>aphelion</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Apol´da</b>, a town of Germany, in Saxe-Weimar, at which woollen
  goods are extensively manufactured. Pop. 22,610.</p>

  <p><b>Apollina´rians</b>, a sect of Christians who maintained the
  doctrine that Christ had a human body and a human sensitive soul, but no
  human rational mind, the Divine Logos (the Word) taking the place of the
  mind, and that God was consequently united in him with the human body and
  the sensitive soul. Apollinaris, the author of this opinion, was, from
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 362 till at least <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 382, Bishop of Laodicea, in Syria, and a zealous
  opposer of the Arians. As a man and a scholar he was highly esteemed, and
  was among the most popular authors of his time. He formed a congregation
  of his adherents at Antioch, and made Vitalis their bishop. The
  <i>Apollinarians</i>, or <i>Vitalians</i>, as their followers were
  called, soon spread their settlements in Syria and the neighbouring
  countries, established several societies, with their own bishops, and one
  even in Constantinople; but many adherents drifted away to Monophysitism,
  and the sect soon became extinct.</p>

  <p><b>Apollina´ris Water</b>, a natural aerated water, belonging to the
  class of acidulated soda waters, and derived from the Apollinarisbrunnen,
  a spring in the valley of the Ahr, near the Rhine, in Rhenish Prussia,
  forming a highly-esteemed beverage.</p>

    Apollo Belvedere (Vatican, Rome)
  </div>

  <p><b>Apol´lo</b>, son of Zeus (Jupiter) and Leto (Latona), who, being
  persecuted by the jealousy of Hera (Juno), after tedious wanderings and
  <!-- Page 200 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page200"></a>[200]</span>nine days' labour, was delivered of him
  and his twin sister, Art&#x115;mis (Diana), on the Island of Delos.
  Skilled in the use of the bow, he slew the serpent Python on the fifth
  day after his birth; afterwards, with his sister Art&#x115;mis, he killed
  the children of Niob&#x113;. He aided Zeus in the war with the Titans and
  the giants. He destroyed the Cyclopes, because they forged the
  thunderbolts with which Zeus killed his son and favourite Asklepios
  (Æsculapius). According to some traditions he invented the lyre, though
  this is generally ascribed to Hermes (Mercury). The brightest creation of
  polytheism, Apollo is also the most complex, and many aspects of the
  people's life were reflected in his cult. He was originally the sun-god;
  and though in Homer he appears distinct from Helios (the sun), yet his
  real nature is hinted at even here by the epithet Ph&oelig;bus, that is,
  the radiant or beaming. In later times the view was almost universal that
  Apollo and Helios were identical. From being the god of light and purity
  in a physical sense, he gradually became the god of moral and spiritual
  light and purity, the source of all intellectual, social, and political
  progress. He thus came to be regarded as the god of song and prophecy,
  the god that wards off and heals bodily suffering and disease, the
  institutor and guardian of civil and political order, and the founder of
  cities. His worship was introduced at Rome at an early period, probably
  in the time of the Tarquins. Among the ancient statues of Apollo that
  have come down to us, the most remarkable is the one called <i>Apollo
  Belvedere</i>, from the Belvedere Gallery in the Vatican at Rome. This
  statue was discovered at Frascati in 1455, and purchased by Pope Julian
  II, the founder of the Vatican museum. It is a copy of a Greek statue of
  the third century <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, and dates probably from
  the reign of Nero.</p>

  <p><b>Apollodo´rus</b>, a Greek writer who flourished 140 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> Among the numerous works he wrote on various
  subjects, the only one extant is his <i>Bibliothec&#x113;</i>, which
  contains a concise account of the mythology of Greece down to the heroic
  age.</p>

  <p><b>Apollo´nius of Perga</b>, Greek mathematician, called the 'great
  geometer', flourished about 240 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, and was
  the author of many works, only one of which, a treatise on <i>Conic
  Sections</i>, partly in Greek and partly in an Arabic translation, is now
  extant.</p>

  <p><b>Apollo´nius of Rhodes</b>, a Greek rhetorician and poet, flourished
  about 230 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> Of his various works we have
  only the <i>Argonautica</i>, an epic poem of considerable merit, though
  perhaps written with too much care and labour. It deals with the story of
  the Argonautic expedition.</p>

  <p><b>Apollo´nius of Ty´ana</b>, in Cappadocia, a Pythagorean philosopher
  who was born in the beginning of the Christian era, early adopted the
  Pythagorean doctrines, abstaining from animal food and maintaining a
  rigid silence for five years. He travelled extensively in Asia, professed
  to be endowed with miraculous powers, such as prophecy and the raising of
  the dead, and was on this account set up by some as a rival to Christ.
  His ascetic life, wise discourses, and wonderful deeds obtained for him
  almost universal reverence, and temples, altars, and statues were erected
  to him. He died at Ephesus about the end of the first century. A
  narrative of his strange career, containing many fables, with, perhaps, a
  kernel of truth, was written by Philostratus about a century later.</p>

  <p><b>Apollo´nius of Tyre</b>, the hero of a tale which had an immense
  popularity in the Middle Ages and which indirectly furnished the plot of
  Shakespeare's <i>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</i>. The story, originally in
  Greek, first appeared in the third century after Christ.</p>

  <p><b>Apoll´os</b>, a Jew of Alexandria, who learned the doctrines of
  Christianity at Ephesus from Aquila and Priscilla, became a preacher of
  the gospel in Achaia and Corinth, and an assistant of Paul in his
  missionary work. Some have regarded him as the author of the <i>Epistle
  to the Hebrews</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Apoll´yon</b> ('the Destroyer'), a name used in <i>Rev.</i> ix, 11
  for the angel of the bottomless pit.</p>

  <p><b>Apologetics</b> (-jet´iks), this term, as used in Christian
  theology, does not carry with it the idea of excuse or regretful
  acknowledgment, but signifies a defensive or vindicatory statement, which
  accords with its meaning in the original Greek. In the conventional
  division of systematic theology apologetics comes first in order, and is
  followed by the disciplines of dogmatics <!-- Page 201 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page201"></a>[201]</span>and ethics, which
  expound Christian belief and Christian duty respectively. There is a
  tendency, however, in the more recent treatment of systematic theology,
  to include the defence or vindication of the various Christian doctrines
  within the dogmatic scheme, leaving to apologetics&mdash;in so far as it
  may be regarded as a separate discipline from dogmatics&mdash;the
  discussion of such general themes as religion and revelation, authority
  and inspiration, and the essence and truth of Christianity. Such
  discussions belong essentially to what is now often called philosophy of
  religion. The preference of the term philosophy of religion to that of
  apologetics is indicative at once of the wider theological outlook of our
  time and of the conciliatory, adaptable, and more sympathetic spirit in
  which the Christian apologist approaches the new thought and
  culture.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: A.&nbsp;B. Bruce,

  Handbook of Christian Apologetics</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Apologue</b> (ap´o-log), a story or relation of fictitious events
  intended to convey some useful truths. It differs from a parable in that
  the latter is drawn from events that take place among mankind, whereas
  the apologue may be founded on supposed actions of brutes or inanimate
  things. Æsop's fables are good examples of apologues.</p>

  <p><b>Apol´ogy,</b> a term at one time applied to a defence of one who is
  accused, or of certain doctrines called in question. Of this nature is
  the <i>Apology of Socrates</i> written by Plato; also a work with the
  same title sometimes attributed to Xenophon. The name passed over to
  Christian authors, who gave the name of apologies to the writings which
  were designed to defend Christianity against the attacks and accusations
  of its enemies, particularly the pagan philosophers, and to justify its
  professors before the emperors. Of this sort were those by Justin Martyr,
  Athenagoras, Tertullian, Tatian, and others.</p>

  <p><b>Aponeuro´sis</b>, in anatomy, a name of certain greyish-white
  shining membranes, composed of interlacing fibres, sometimes continuous
  with the muscular fibre, and differing from tendons merely in having a
  flat form. They serve several purposes, sometimes attaching the muscles
  to the bones, sometimes surrounding the muscle and preventing its
  displacement, &amp;c. See <i>Anatomy</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Apophthegm</b> (ap´o-them), a short pithy sentence or maxim. Julius
  Cæsar wrote a collection of them, and we have a collection by Francis
  Bacon.</p>

  <p><b>Apoph´yllite</b>, a species of mineral of a foliated structure and
  pearly lustre, called also fish-eye stone. It belongs to the Zeolite
  family, and is a hydrated silicate of lime and potash, containing also
  fluorine.</p>

  <p><b>Ap´oplexy</b>, sudden abolition of consciousness, followed after
  recovery of consciousness by persistent disturbance of sensation or
  voluntary motion, from suspension of the functions of the cerebrum,
  resulting from blocking or rupture of the blood-vessels of the brain. In
  a complete apoplexy the person falls suddenly, is unable to move his
  limbs or to speak, gives no proof of seeing, hearing, or feeling, and the
  breathing is stertorous or snoring, like that of a person in deep sleep.
  The premonitory symptoms of this dangerous disease are drowsiness,
  giddiness, dulness of hearing, frequent yawning, disordered vision, noise
  in the ears, vertigo, &amp;c. It is most frequent between the ages of
  fifty and seventy. A large head, short neck, full chest, sanguine and
  plethoric constitution, and corpulency are generally considered signs of
  predisposition to it; but the state of the heart's action, with a
  plethoric condition of the vascular system, has a more marked influence.
  Out of sixty-three cases carefully investigated only ten were fat and
  plethoric, twenty-three being thin, and the rest of ordinary habit. The
  common predisposing causes are disease or senile changes in the
  blood-vessels and affections of the valves of the heart; but other
  factors may possibly play some part either as exciting or predisposing
  causes, such as long and intense thought, continued anxiety, habitual
  indulgence of the temper and passions, sedentary and luxurious living,
  sexual indulgence, intoxication, &amp;c. More or less complete recovery
  from a first and second attack is common, but a third is almost
  invariably fatal.&mdash;Cf. Grasset, <i>Traité du système
  nerveux</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Aposiope´sis</b>, in rhetoric, a sudden break or stop in speaking
  or writing, usually for mere effect or a pretence of unwillingness to say
  anything on a subject; as, 'his character is such&mdash;but it is better
  I should not speak of <i>that</i>', or Virgil's "Quos ego&mdash;sed motos
  praestat componere fluctus" (<i>Aen.</i> I, 135).</p>

  <p><b>Apos´tasy</b> (Gr. <i>apostasis</i>, a standing away from), a
  renunciation of opinions or practices and the adoption of contrary ones,
  usually applied to renunciation of religious opinions. It is always an
  expression of reproach. What one party calls <i>apostasy</i> is termed by
  the other <i>conversion</i>. Catholics, also, call those persons
  <i>apostates</i> who forsake a religious order or renounce their
  religious vows without a lawful dispensation.</p>

  <p><b>A posterio´ri.</b> See <i>A priori</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Apos´tles</b> (literally, persons sent out, from the Gr.
  <i>apostellein</i>, to send out), the twelve men whom Jesus selected to
  attend him during his ministry, and to promulgate his religion. Their
  names were as follows: Simon Peter, and Andrew his brother; James, and
  John his brother, <!-- Page 202 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page202"></a>[202]</span>sons of Zebedee; Philip; Bartholomew;
  Thomas; Matthew; James, the son of Alpheus; Lebbæus his brother, called
  <i>Judas</i> or <i>Jude</i>; Simon, the Canaanite; and Judas Iscariot. To
  these were subsequently added Matthias (chosen by lot in place of Judas
  Iscariot) and Paul. The Bible gives the name of apostle to Barnabas also,
  who accompanied Paul on his missions (<i>Acts</i>, xiv, 14). In a wider
  sense those preachers who first taught Christianity in heathen countries
  are sometimes termed apostles; for example, St. Denis, the apostle of the
  Gauls; St. Boniface, the apostle of Germany; St. Augustine, the apostle
  of England; Francis Xavier, the apostle of the Indies; Adalbert of
  Prague, apostle of Prussia Proper. During the life of the Saviour the
  apostles more than once showed a misunderstanding of the object of His
  mission, and during His sufferings evinced little courage and firmness of
  friendship for their great and benevolent Teacher. After His death they
  received the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost, that they might be
  enabled to fulfil the important duties for which they had been chosen.
  According to one interpretation of <i>Matthew</i>, xvi, 18, Christ seems
  to appoint St. Peter the first of the apostles; and the Pope claims
  supreme authority from the power which Christ thus gave to St. Peter, of
  whom all the Popes, according to the Catholic dogma, are successors in an
  uninterrupted line.</p>

  <p><b>Apostles' Creed</b>, a well-known formula or declaration of
  Christian belief, formerly believed to be the work of the apostles
  themselves, but it can only be traced to the fourth century. See
  <i>Creed</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Apostol´ic</b>, or <b>Apostol´ical</b>, pertaining or relating to
  the apostles.&mdash;<i>Apostolic Church</i>, the Church in the time of
  the apostles, constituted according to their design. The name is also
  given to the four churches of Rome, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem,
  and is claimed by the Roman Catholic Church, and occasionally by the
  Episcopalians.&mdash;<i>Apostolic Constitutions</i> and <i>Canons</i>, a
  collection of regulations attributed to the apostles, but generally
  supposed to be spurious. They appeared in the fourth century, are divided
  into eight books, and consist of rules and precepts relating to the duty
  of Christians, and particularly to the ceremonies and discipline of the
  Church.&mdash;<i>Apostolic fathers</i>, the Christian writers who during
  any part of their lives were contemporary with the apostles. There are
  five&mdash;Clement, Barnabas, Hermas, Ignatius,
  Polycarp.&mdash;<i>Apostolic king</i>, a title granted by the Pope to the
  kings of Hungary, first conferred on St. Stephen, the founder of the
  royal line of Hungary, on account of what he accomplished in the spread
  of Christianity.&mdash;<i>Apostolic see</i>, the see of the Popes or
  Bishops of Rome: so called because the Popes profess themselves the
  successors of St. Peter, its founder.&mdash;<i>Apostolic succession</i>,
  the uninterrupted succession of bishops, and, through them, of priests
  and deacons (these three orders of ministers being called the
  <i>apostolical orders</i>), in the Church by regular ordination from the
  first apostles down to the present day. All Episcopal churches hold
  theoretically, and the Roman Catholic Church and many members of the
  English Church strictly, that such succession is essential to the
  officiating priest, in order that grace may be communicated through his
  administrations.</p>

  <p><b>Apostol´ics</b>, <b>Apostolici</b>, or <b>Apostolic Brethren</b>,
  the name given to certain sects who professed to imitate the manners and
  practice of the apostles. The last and most important of these sects was
  founded about 1260 by Gerhard Segarelli of Parma. They went barefooted,
  begging, preaching, and singing throughout Italy, Switzerland, and
  France; announced the coming of the kingdom of heaven and of purer times;
  denounced the papacy, and its corrupt and worldly church; and inculcated
  the complete renunciation of all worldly ties, of property, settled
  abode, marriage, &amp;c. This society was formally abolished, 1286, by
  Honorius IV. In 1300 Segarelli was burned as a heretic, but another chief
  apostle appeared&mdash;Dolcino, a learned man of Milan. In self-defence
  they stationed themselves in fortified places whence they might resist
  attacks. After having devastated a large tract of country belonging to
  Milan they were subdued, <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1307, by the
  troops of Bishop Raynerius, in their fortress Zebello, in Vercelli, and
  almost all destroyed. Dolcino was burned. The survivors afterwards
  appeared in Lombardy and in the south of France as late as 1368.</p>

  <p><b>Apo´str&#x14F;ph&#x113;</b> (Gr., 'a turning away from'), a
  rhetorical figure by which the orator changes the course of his speech,
  and makes a short impassioned address to one absent as if he were
  present, or to things without life and sense as if they had life and
  sense. The same term is also applied to a comma when used to contract a
  word, or to mark the possessive case, as in 'John's book'.</p>

  <p><b>Apothecaries' weight</b>, the weight used in dispensing drugs, in
  which the pound (lb.) is divided into 12 ounces (<a
  href="images/ounce.png"><img src="images/ounce.png" class="middle"
  style="height:2.5ex" alt="ounce" /></a>), the ounce into 8 drachms (<a
  href="images/drachm.png"><img src="images/drachm.png" class="middle"

  style="height:2.5ex" alt="scruple" /></a>), and the scruple into 20
  grains (grs.), the grain being equivalent to that in avoirdupois
  weight.</p>

  <p><b>Apoth´ecary</b>, in a general sense, one who keeps a shop or
  laboratory for preparing, compounding, and vending medicines, and for the
  making up of medical prescriptions. In England the term was long applied
  (as to some little extent still) to a regularly licensed class of medical
  practitioners, being such persons as were members of, <!-- Page 203
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203"></a>[203]</span>or licensed
  by, the <i>Apothecaries' Company</i> in London. The apothecaries of
  London were at one time ranked with the grocers, with whom they were
  incorporated by James I in 1606. In 1617, however, the apothecaries
  received a new charter as a distinct company. They were not yet regarded
  as having the right to prescribe, but only to dispense, medicines; but in
  1703 the House of Lords conferred that right on them, and they afterwards
  became a well-established branch of the medical profession. In 1815 an
  Act was passed providing that no person should practise as an apothecary
  in any part of England or Wales unless after serving an apprenticeship of
  five years with a member of the society, and receiving a certificate from
  the society's examiners. As in country places every practitioner must be
  to some extent an apothecary, this Act gave the society an undue
  influence over the medical profession. Dissatisfaction therefore long
  prevailed, but nothing of importance was done till the Medical Act of
  1858, which brought the desired reform. The Apothecaries' Society,
  governed by a master, two wardens, and twenty-two assistants, has
  prescribed a course of medical instruction and practice which candidates
  for the licence of the society must pass through. Since 1874
  apprenticeship has not been necessary.</p>

  <p><b>Apothe´cium</b>, in botany, the receptacle of lichens, consisting
  of the spore-cases or asci, and of the paraphyses or barren threads.</p>

  <p><b>Apotheo´sis</b> (deification), a solemnity among the ancients by
  which a mortal was raised to the rank of the gods. The custom of placing
  mortals, who had rendered their countrymen important services, among the
  gods was very ancient among the Greeks. The Romans, for several
  centuries, deified none but Romulus, and first imitated the Greeks in the
  fashion of frequent apotheosis after the time of Cæsar. From this period
  apotheosis was regulated by the decrees of the senate, and accompanied
  with great solemnities. Almost all the Roman emperors were deified.</p>

  <p><b>Appalachian Mountains</b> (ap-pa-l&#x101;´chi-an), also called
  <b>Alleghanies</b>, a vast mountain range in N. America extending for
  1300 miles from Cape Gaspé on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, s.w. to Alabama.
  The system has been divided into three great sections: the
  <i>northern</i> (including the Adirondacks, the Green Mountains, the
  White Mountains, &amp;c.), from Cape Gaspé to New York; the
  <i>central</i> (including a large portion of the Blue Ridge, the
  Alleghanies proper, and numerous lesser ranges), from New York to the
  valley of the New River; and the <i>southern</i> (including the
  continuation of the Blue Ridge, the Black Mountains, the Smoky Mountains,
  &amp;c.), from the New River southwards. The chain consists of several
  ranges generally parallel to each other, the altitude of the individual
  mountains increasing on approaching the south. The highest peaks rise
  over 6600 feet (not one at all approaching the snow-level), but the mean
  height is about 2500 feet. Lake Champlain is the only lake of great
  importance in the system, but numerous rivers of considerable size take
  their rise here. Magnetite, hematite, and other iron ores occur in great
  abundance, and the coal-measures are among the most extensive in the
  world. Gold, silver, lead, and copper are also found in small quantities,
  while marble, limestone, fire-clay, gypsum, and salt abound. The forests
  covering many of the ranges yield large quantities of valuable timber,
  such as sugar-maple, white birch, beech, ash, oak, cherry tree, white
  poplar, white and yellow pine, &amp;c., while they form the haunts of
  large numbers of bears, panthers, wild cats, and wolves.</p>

  <p><b>Appalachicola</b> (-chi-c&#x14D;´la), a river of the United States,
  formed by the Chattahoochee and Flint Rivers, which unite near the
  northern border of Florida; length, about 100 miles; it flows into the
  Gulf of Mexico, and is navigable.</p>

  <p><b>Appam</b>, the name of a British merchant ship of the
  Elder-Dempster line captured by the German raiding cruiser <i>Moewe</i>
  (Sea-gull) on 16th Jan., 1916. A German prize crew succeeded in bringing
  the <i>Appam</i> westward, and was able to pass the British cordon off
  Chesapeake Bay and to reach Norfolk, Virginia. The vessel was carrying,
  among others, an ex-governor of Sierra Leone and some military officers
  from the west coast of Africa, but the passengers were at once released
  and allowed to return to England.</p>

  <p><b>Appanage.</b> See <i>Apanage</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Appa´rent</b>, among mathematicians and astronomers, applied to
  things as they appear to the eye, in distinction to what they really are.
  Thus they speak of apparent motion, magnitude, distance, height, &amp;c.
  The <i>apparent magnitude</i> of a heavenly body is the angle subtended
  at the spectator's eye by the diameter of that body, and this, of course,
  depends on the distance as well as the real magnitude of the body;
  <i>apparent motion</i> is the motion a body seems to have in consequence
  of our own motion, as the motion of the sun from east to west,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Appari´tion</b>, according to a belief held by some, a disembodied
  spirit manifesting itself to mortal sight; according to the common theory
  an illusion involuntarily generated, by means of which figures or forms,
  not present to the actual sense, are nevertheless depicted with a
  vividness and intensity sufficient to create a temporary belief in their
  reality. Such illusions are now generally held to result from an
  over-excited brain, a strong imagination, or some bodily malady. In
  perfect health the mind not only possesses a control over its powers, but
  the <!-- Page 204 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page204"></a>[204]</span>impressions of the external objects alone
  occupy its attention, and the play of imagination is consequently
  checked, except in sleep, when its operations are relatively more feeble
  and faint. But in an unhealthy state of the mind, when its attention is
  partly withdrawn from the contemplation of external objects, the
  impressions of its own creation, or rather reproduction, will either
  overpower or combine themselves with the impressions of external objects,
  and thus generate illusions which in the one case appear alone, while in
  the other they are seen projected among those external objects to which
  the eyeball is directed. This theory explains satisfactorily a large
  majority of the stories of apparitions; still there are some which it
  seems insufficient to account for.&mdash;See <i>Crystal Gazing</i>,
  <i>Hypnotism</i>, <i>Spiritualism</i>.&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Appeal´</b>, in legal phraseology, the removal of a cause from an
  inferior tribunal to a superior, in order that the latter may revise, and
  if it seem needful reverse or amend, the decision of the former. The
  supreme court of appeal for Great Britain is the House of Lords. Certain
  defects in connection with the settlement of appeals by this body were
  remedied by the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1876, while a new court of
  appeal was established as a division of the Supreme Court of Judicature.
  In Ireland there is also a Court of Appeal similar to that in England;
  while in Scotland the highest court is the Court of Session. From the
  decisions of the Indian and all colonial courts, and the courts of the
  Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, appeal may be made to the Privy
  Council. Appeals from the decisions of justices of a borough or county
  may be made to the quarter-sessions of either respectively, in cases of
  summary jurisdiction, or upon a point of law to divisional courts of the
  High Court of Justice, which was established at the same time as the
  Court of Appeal; from quarter-sessions, county and other inferior courts,
  to the High Court. In Scotland the Court of Session reviews the decisions
  of the county courts, there being an appeal from its decisions to the
  House of Lords.&mdash;In France the court of final appeal in all cases is
  the <i>cour de cassation</i>.&mdash;In the United States the system of
  appeals differs in different States.</p>

  <p><b>Appearance in law</b> is the first formal act incumbent on a
  defendant who intends to resist the claim in the writ or action served
  upon him. It consists usually in lodging in court a written notice
  stating simply that the defendant intends to dispute the claim. Failure
  to enter appearance within the prescribed time entails decree passing
  against the defendant in absence, but procedure exists in all courts for
  enabling such decrees to be recalled within a limited period. Appearance
  should be entered under protest if it is desired to dispute the
  jurisdiction of the court or the regularity of the writ.</p>

  <p><b>Appendicitis</b>, a disease which has become well known in recent
  times through the more accurate methods of diagnosis and the increased
  safety of surgical operation. It is caused by inflammation of the
  vermiform appendix, a narrow, hollow, worm-like body from 2 to 4 inches
  long, opening at one end into the large intestine and forming a
  cul-de-sac at the other. In appendicitis the inflammation begins in the
  appendix and frequently spreads to the neighbouring parts, causing
  inflammation of the cæcum, a condition known as perityphlitis. The most
  frequent cause of appendicitis is a hard piece of insufficiently-digested
  food becoming lodged in the appendix. Occasionally orange pips, grape
  stones, &amp;c., are the cause, though not so often as is popularly
  supposed.</p>

  <p>The symptoms are: abdominal pain (especially low down at the right
  side), fever, nausea, vomiting, constipation; these varying according to
  the intensity of the attack. Three types are recognized:</p>

  <p>1. A mild type, when the symptoms subside in a few days and the
  patient soon <i>appears</i> to be in normal health.</p>

  <p>2. A severe type, in which, if left alone, the appendix bursts into
  the abdominal cavity and death from general peritonitis results.</p>

  <p>3. Another type, in which the inflammation in the appendix leads to
  the formation of a localized abscess, sometimes of great size.</p>

  <p>The treatment for the severe and for the abscess-forming types is
  essentially immediate operation; while for the mild type operation may
  either be performed at once or after the attack has passed off. Anyone
  who has had one attack of appendicitis is liable to have it repeated in a
  much severer form, hence the advisability of having the appendix removed
  after the first attack, however slight. During an attack, prior to
  surgical interference, complete rest in bed is essential. Abdominal pain
  should be treated with frequent hot fomentations, and the diet should be
  reduced to small quantities of fluid.</p>

  <p><b>Appenzell</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>p'pen-tsel), a Swiss canton, wholly
  enclosed by the canton of St. Gall; area, 162 sq. miles. It is divided
  into two independent portions or half-cantons, Outer-Rhoden, which is
  Protestant, and Inner-Rhoden, which is Catholic. It is an elevated
  district, traversed by branches of the Alps; Mount Säntis in the centre
  being 8250 feet high. It is watered by the Sitter and by several smaller
  affluents of the Rhine. Glaciers occupy the higher valleys. Flax, hemp,
  grain, fruit, &amp;c., are produced, but the wealth of Inner-Rhoden lies
  in its herds <!-- Page 205 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page205"></a>[205]</span>and flocks&mdash;that of Outer-Rhoden in
  its manufactures of embroidered muslins, gauzes, cambrics, and other
  cotton stuffs; also of silk goods and paper. The town of Appenzell (Ger.
  <i>Abtenzelle</i>, abbot's cell) is the capital of Inner-Rhoden, on the
  Sitter, with about 4300 inhabitants. Trogen is the capital of
  Outer-Rhoden, Herisau the largest town (pop. 11,000). Pop. Outer-Rhoden,
  60,000; Inner-Rhoden, 15,000.</p>

  <p><b>Apperception.</b> See <i>Metaphysics</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Ap´petite</b>, in its widest sense, means the natural desire for
  gratification, either of the body or the mind; but is generally applied
  to the recurrent and intermittent desire for food. A healthy appetite is
  favoured by work, exercise, plain living, and cheerfulness; absence of
  this feeling, or defective appetite (<i>anorexia</i>), indicates diseased
  action of the stomach, or of the nervous system or circulation, or it may
  result from vicious habits. Depraved appetite (<i>pica</i>), or a desire
  for unnatural food, as chalk, ashes, dirt, soap, &amp;c., depends often
  in the case of children on vicious tastes or habits; in grown-up persons
  it may be symptomatic of dyspepsia, pregnancy or chlorosis. Insatiable or
  canine appetite or voracity (<i>bulimia</i>) when it occurs in childhood
  is generally symptomatic of worms; in adults common causes are pregnancy,
  vicious habits, and indigestion caused by stomach complaints or gluttony,
  when the gnawing pains of disease are mistaken for hunger.</p>

  <p><b>Ap´pian</b>, a Roman historian of the second century after Christ,
  a native of Alexandria, was governor and manager of the imperial revenues
  under Hadrian, Trajan, and Antoninus Pius, in Rome. He compiled in Greek
  a Roman history, from the earliest times to those of Augustus, in
  twenty-four books, of which only eleven have come down to us. Appian's
  style is not attractive, but he gives us much valuable information.</p>

  <p><b>Appia´ni</b>, Andrea, a painter, born at Milan in 1754, died in
  1817. As a fresco-painter he excelled every contemporary painter in
  Italy. He displayed his skill particularly in the cupola of Santa Maria
  di S. Celso at Milan, and in the paintings representing the legend of
  Cupid and Psyche prepared for the walls and ceiling of the villa of the
  Archduke Ferdinand at Monza (1795). Napoleon appointed him royal court
  painter, and portraits of almost the whole of the imperial family were
  painted by him.</p>

  <p><b>Appian Way</b>, called <i>Regina Viarum</i>, the Queen of Roads:
  the oldest and most renowned Roman road, was constructed during the
  censorship of Appius Claudius Cæcus (313-310 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>). It was built with large square stones on a
  raised platform, and was made direct from the gates of Rome to Capua, in
  Campania. It was afterwards extended through Samnium and Apulia to
  Brundusium, the modern Brindisi. It was partially restored by Pius VI,
  and between 1850 and 1853 it was excavated by order of Pius IX as far as
  the eleventh milestone from Rome.</p>

  <p><b>Appius Claudius</b>, surnamed <i>Cæcus</i>, or the blind, a Roman
  patrician, elected censor 312 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, which
  office he held four years. While in this position he made every effort to
  weaken the power of the Plebs, and constructed the road and aqueduct
  named after him. He was subsequently twice consul, and once dictator. In
  his old age he became blind, but in 280 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> he
  made a famous speech in which he induced the senate to reject the terms
  of peace fixed by Pyrrhus. He is the earliest Roman writer of prose and
  verse whose name we know.</p>

  <p><b>Appius Claudius Crassus</b>, one of the Roman <i>decemvirs</i>,
  appointed 451 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> to draw up a new code of
  laws. He and his colleagues plotted to retain their power permanently,
  and at the expiry of their year of office refused to give up their
  authority. The people were incensed against them, and the following
  circumstances led to their overthrow. Appius Claudius had conceived an
  evil passion for Virginia, the daughter of Lucius Virginius, then absent
  with the army in the war with the Æqui and Sabines. At the instigation of
  Appius, Marcus Claudius, one of his clients, claimed Virginia as the
  daughter of one of his own female slaves, and the <i>decemvir</i>, acting
  as judge, decided that in the meantime she should remain in the custody
  of the claimant. Virginius, hastily summoned from the army, appeared with
  his daughter next day in the forum, and appealed to the people; but
  Appius Claudius again adjudged her to Marcus Claudius. Unable to rescue
  his daughter, the unhappy father stabbed her to the heart. The

  <p><b>Apple</b> (<i>Pyrus Malus</i>), the fruit of a well-known tree of
  the nat. ord. Rosaceæ, or the tree itself. The apple belongs to the
  temperate regions of the globe, over which it is almost universally
  spread and cultivated. The tree attains a moderate height, with spreading
  branches; the leaf is ovate; and the flowers are produced from the wood
  of the former year; but more generally from very short shoots or spurs
  from wood of two years' growth. The original of all the varieties of the
  cultivated apple is the wild crab, which has a small and extremely sour
  fruit, and is a native of most of the countries of Europe. Apples have
  been used as food and cultivated for upwards of 4000 years, and were
  probably introduced into Britain by the Romans. The greater number of the
  varieties now grown have, however, been cultivated only within the last
  century or so. To the facility of multiplying varieties by grafting is to
  be ascribed the amazing extension <!-- Page 206 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page206"></a>[206]</span>of the sorts of apples,
  the number of varieties known being over 2000. Many of the more marked
  varieties are known by general names, as pippins, codlins, rennets,
  &amp;c. The oldest apple in cultivation is a variety called 'the lady',
  which originated in Britain early in the seventeenth century. Apples for
  the table are characterized by a firm juicy pulp, a sweetish acid
  flavour, regular form, and beautiful colouring; those for cooking by the
  property of forming by the aid of heat into a pulpy mass of equal
  consistency, as also by their large size and keeping properties; apples
  for cider must have a considerable degree of astringency, with richness
  of juice. The propagation of apple trees is accomplished by seeds,
  cuttings, suckers, layers, budding, or grafting, the last being almost
  the universal practice. The tree thrives best in an open situation where
  it will receive the maximum amount of sunshine and protection from cold
  winds. The protection is particularly necessary in districts where cold
  winds and frosts prevail during the flowering season. The wood of the
  apple tree or the common crab is hard, close-grained, and often richly
  coloured, and is suitable for turning and cabinet work. The fermented
  juice (<i>verjuice</i>) of the crab is employed in cookery and medicine.
  Apples are largely imported into Great Britain from the Continent and the
  United States and Canada. The designation apple, with various modifying
  words, is applied to a number of fruits having nothing in common with the
  apple proper, as alligator-apple, love-apple, &amp;c.&mdash;Cf. A.&nbsp;E.

  <p><b>Appren´tice</b>, one bound by indenture to serve some particular
  individual or company of individuals for a specified time, in order to be
  instructed in some art, science, or trade. In England a person under the
  age of twenty-one cannot bind himself apprentice, and accordingly the
  usual way is for a relation or friend to become a contracting party to
  the indenture, and engage for the faithful performance of the agreement.
  <!-- Page 207 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  fourteen or a girl under twelve years of age cannot become a party to an
  indenture without the concurrence of a parent or guardian; above that age
  they may enter into an indenture of themselves, and thereby become
  personally bound. An indenture is determinable by the consent of the
  parties to it, and also by the death, bankruptcy, or retirement from
  business of the master. <i>Parish apprentices</i> are bound out by the
  guardians of the poor to suitable persons, and in this case the consent
  of the apprentice is not necessary. The system of apprenticing by

  <p><b>Ap´ricot</b> (<i>Prunus Armeni&#x103;ca</i>), a fruit of the plum
  genus which was introduced into Europe from Asia more than three
  centuries before Christ, and into England from Italy in 1524. It is a
  native of Armenia and other parts of Asia and also of Africa. The apricot
  is a low tree, of rather crooked growth, with somewhat heart-shaped
  leaves and sessile flowers. The fruit is sweet, more or less juicy, of a
  yellowish colour, about the size of a peach, and resembling it in
  delicacy of flavour. Some of the best varieties are 'Frogmore Early',
  'Moorpark', 'Royal', &amp;c. The wood is coarsely grained and soft.
  Apricot trees are chiefly raised against walls, and are propagated by
  budding and grafting.</p>

  <p><b>Apries</b> (&#x101;´pri-&#x113;z), Pharaoh-Hophra of Scripture, the
  eighth king of the twenty-sixth Egyptian dynasty. He succeeded his father
  Psammetichus in 590 or 589 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> The Jews under
  Zedekiah revolted against their Babylonian oppressors and allied
  themselves with Apries, who was, however, unable to raise the siege of
  Jerusalem, which was taken by Nebuchadnezzar. A still more unfortunate
  expedition against Cyrene brought about revolt in his army, in
  endeavouring to suppress which Apries was defeated and slain about 570
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span></p>

  <p><b>A´pril</b> (Lat. <i>Apr&#x12B;lis</i>, from <i>aperire</i>, to
  open, because the buds open at this time), the fourth month of the year.
  The strange custom of making fools on 1st April by sending people upon
  errands which end in disappointment, and raise a laugh at the expense of
  the person sent, prevails throughout Europe. It has been connected with
  the miracle plays of the Middle Ages, in which the Saviour was
  represented as having been sent, at this period of the year, from Annas
  to Caiaphas and from Pilate to Herod. This explanation, however, is
  perhaps itself a piece of April fooling. In France the party fooled is
  called <i>un poisson d'avril</i>, 'an April fish'; in Scotland, a 'gowk',
  or cuckoo.</p>

  <p><b>A prio´ri</b> ('from what goes before'), a phrase applied to a mode

  acquired. Mathematical proofs are of the <i>a priori</i> kind; the
  conclusions of experimental science are <i>a posteriori</i>. It is also a
  term applied to knowledge independent of all experience.</p>

  <p><b>Aqua´rium</b>, a vessel or series of vessels constructed wholly or
  partly of glass and containing salt or fresh water in which are kept
  living specimens of marine or fresh-water animals along with aquatic
  plants. In principle the aquarium is based on the interdependence of
  animal and vegetable life; animals consuming oxygen and exhaling carbonic
  acid, plants reversing the process by absorbing carbonic acid and giving
  out oxygen. The aquarium must consequently be stocked both with plants
  and animals, and for the welfare of both something like a proper
  proportion should exist between them. The simplest form of aquarium is
  that of a glass vase; but aquaria on a larger scale consist of a tank or
  a number of tanks with plate-glass sides and stone floors, and contain
  sand and gravel, rocks, sea-weeds, &amp;c. By improved arrangements light
  is admitted from above, passing through the water in the tanks and
  illuminating their contents, while the spectator is in comparative
  darkness. The most important aquarium is at the zoological station at
  Naples. There is also one, on a smaller scale, at Plymouth, maintained by
  the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom. Aquaria on a
  large scale have been constructed in connection with public parks or
  gardens, and the name is also given to places of public entertainment in
  which large aquaria are exhibited.&mdash;Cf. G.&nbsp;C. Bateman,

  <p><b>Aquatint</b>, a method of etching on copper by which a beautiful
  effect is produced, resembling a fine drawing in sepia or Indian ink. The
  special character of the effect is the result of sprinkling
  finely-powdered resin or mastic over the plate, and causing this to
  adhere by heat, the design being previously etched, or being now traced
  out. The nitric acid (aqua fortis) acts only in the interstices between
  the particles of resin or mastic, thus giving a slightly granular
  appearance.</p>

  <p><b>Aq´ueduct</b> (Lat. <i>aqua</i>, water, <i>duco</i>, to lead), an
  artificial channel or conduit for the conveyance of water from one place
  to another: more particularly applied to structures for conveying water
  from distant sources for the supply of large cities. Aqueducts were
  extensively used by the Romans, and many of them still remain in
  different places on the Continent of Europe, some being still in use. The
  Pont du Gard in the south of France, 14 miles from Nîmes, is still nearly
  perfect, and is a grand monument of the Roman occupation of this country.
  The ancient aqueducts were constructed of stone or brick, sometimes
  tunnelled through hills, and carried over valleys and rivers on arches.
  The Pont du Gard spans the River Gard, and was built to convey to Nîmes
  the water of springs rising in the neighbourhood of the modern Uzés. It
  is built of great blocks of stone; its height is 160 feet; length of the
  highest arcade, 882 feet. The aqueduct at Segovia, originally built by
  the Romans, has in some parts two tiers of arcades 100 feet high, is 2921
  feet in length, and is one of the most admired works of antiquity. One of
  the most remarkable aqueducts of modern times is that constructed by
  Louis XIV for conveying the waters of the Eure to Versailles. The
  extensive application of metal pipes has rendered the construction of
  aqueducts of the old type less necessary; but what may be called aqueduct
  bridges are still frequently constructed in connection with canals and
  also with water-works for the supply of towns. Where canals exist canal
  aqueducts are common, since the water in any section of a canal must be
  kept on a perfect level.</p>

  <p>Many large towns now derive a supply of water from sources at a great
  distance, and in <!-- Page 210 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page210"></a>[210]</span>bringing the water to the place where it
  is required much tunnelling is often necessary as well as digging and
  excavating in the open. A tunnel furnishing a water channel may be driven
  through miles of rock strata of various kinds, and in many places it may
  have to be lined with concrete or cement wholly or partially, brick-work
  also being much employed. Instead of tunnelling, the channel may be
  formed on the plan of 'cut and cover', being first cut in the ground and
  then covered over, leaving the surface much in the same state as before.
  And, of course, iron piping is often used in connection with such
  tunnels, the water being conveyed so far in an aqueduct of one kind, and
  so far in one of another kind, according as is deemed most suitable. In
  the Thirlmere aqueduct, which brings water to Manchester, there are 45
  miles of cast-iron pipes, 37 miles of cut-and-cover work, and 14 miles of
  tunnels proper. Pipes are naturally laid where valleys occur, and the
  water simply enters the pipes at one end and flows out at the other by
  the influence of gravity, there being a suitable chamber constructed at
  either end of the pipe line where there is a junction with a section of
  tunnel. Aqueduct bridges were first introduced into England in the
  eighteenth century, the first being the aqueduct at Barton Bridge
  conveying the Bridgewater Canal across the Irwell. In such bridges the
  water-channel may be made of cast iron. There are great aqueduct bridges
  on some of the Indian canals, such as the Nadrai bridge on the Lower
  Ganges Canal. In America water is often carried long distances in
  <i>flumes</i> or open wooden channels, supported, where necessary, on
  trestles. Great wooden pipes are also common there, built of large staves
  and hooped round with iron or steel. These often rest on the surface of
  the ground without any covering.&mdash;<span

  years. About the age of seventeen he entered a convent of Dominicans,
  much against the wishes of his family. He attended the lectures of
  Albertus Magnus at Cologne, in whose company he visited Paris in 1245 or
  1246. Here he became involved in the dispute between the university and
  the Begging Friars as to the liberty of teaching, advocating the rights
  claimed by the latter with great energy. In 1257 he received the degree
  of doctor from the Sorbonne, and began to lecture on theology, rapidly
  acquiring the highest reputation. In 1263 he is found at the Chapter of
  the Dominicans in London. In 1268 he was in Italy, lecturing in Rome,
  Bologna, and elsewhere. In 1271 he was again in Paris lecturing to the
  students; in 1272 he was professor at Naples. In 1263 he had been offered
  the archbishopric of Naples by Clement IV, but refused the offer. He
  died, in 1274, on his way to Lyons to attend a general council for the
  purpose of uniting the Greek and Latin Churches. He was called, after the
  fashion of the times, the <i>angelic doctor</i>, and was canonized by
  John XXII. The most important of his numerous works, which are all
  written in Latin, are the <i>Summa Theologica</i>, <!-- Page 211 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page211"></a>[211]</span>which, although only
  professing to treat of theology, is in reality a complete and systematic
  summary of the knowledge of the time, and the <i>Summa Philosophica</i>.
  The work of St. Thomas consisted in an effort to harmonize the new
  scientific teachings of the age&mdash;derived from Arabian and Byzantine
  sources&mdash;with the doctrine of the Church, and to refute heresy. His
  disciples were known as <i>Thomists</i>. See <i>Thomism</i>.&mdash;Cf. P.

  <p><b>Aquita´nia</b>, later <b>Aquitaine</b>, a Roman province in Gaul,
  which comprehended the countries on the coast from the Garonne to the
  Pyrenees, and from the sea to Toulouse. It was brought into connection
  with England by the marriage of Henry II with Eleanor, daughter of the
  last Duke of Aquitaine. The title to the province was for long disputed
  by England and France, but it was finally secured by the latter
  (1453).</p>

  <p><b>Arabah´</b>, a deep rocky valley or depression in north-western

  <p><b>Arabesque</b> (ar´a-besk), a species of ornamentation for enriching
  flat surfaces, often consisting of fanciful figures, human or animal,
  combined with floral forms. There may be said to be three periods and
  distinctive varieties of arabesque&mdash;(<i>a</i>) the Roman or
  Græco-Roman, introduced into Rome from the East when pure art was
  declining; (<i>b</i>) the Arabesque of the Moors as seen in the Alhambra,
  introduced by them into Europe in the Middle Ages; (<i>c</i>) Modern
  Arabesque, which took its rise in Italy in the Renaissance period of art.
  The arabesques of the Moors, who are prohibited by their religion from
  representing animal forms, consist essentially of complicated ornamental
  designs based on the suggestion of plant-growth, combined with extremely
  complex geometrical forms.</p>

  <p><b>Arabgir</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>-ra<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>b-g&#x113;r´), or <b>Arabkir´</b>, a town
  in Asia, 147 miles <span class="scac">W.S.W.</span> of Erzerum, noted for
  its manufacture of silk and cotton goods. Pop. between 20,000 and
  30,000.</p>

  <p><b>Ara´bia</b>, a vast peninsula in the S.W. of Asia, bounded on the
  <span class="scac">N.</span> by the great Syro-Babylonian plain, <span
  class="scac">N.E.</span> by the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman, <span
  class="scac">S.</span> or <span class="scac">S.E.</span> by the Indian
  Ocean, and <span class="scac">S.W.</span> by the Red Sea and Gulf of
  Suez. Its length from <span class="scac">N.W.</span> to <span
  class="scac">S.E.</span> is about 1800 miles, its mean breadth about 600
  miles, its area approximately 1,200,000 sq. miles, its population
  probably less than 5,000,000. Roughly described, it exhibits a central
  table-land surrounded by a series of deserts, with numerous scattered
  oases, while around this is a line of mountains parallel to and
  approaching the coasts, and with a narrow rim of low grounds
  (<i>teh&#x101;ma</i>) between them and the sea. In its general features
  Arabia resembles the Sahara, of which it may be considered a
  continuation. Like the Sahara, it has its wastes of loose sand, its
  stretches of bare rocks and stones, its mountains devoid of vegetation,
  its oases with their wells and streams, their palm-groves and cultivated
  fields&mdash;islands of green amidst the surrounding desolation. Rivers
  proper there are none. By the ancients the whole peninsula was broadly
  divided into three great sections&mdash;Arabia Petræa (containing the
  city Petra), Deserta (desert), and Felix (happy). The first and last of
  these answer roughly to the modern divisions of the region of Sinai in
  the <span class="scac">N.W.</span> and Yemen in the <span
  class="scac">S.W.</span>, while the name <i>Deserta</i> was vaguely given
  to the rest of the country. (See <i>Explorations, Modern</i>.) The
  principal divisions at the present are Madian in the north-west; south of
  this, Hejaz, Assir, and Yemen, all on the Red Sea, the last named
  occupying the south-western part of the peninsula, and comprising a
  <i>teh&#x101;ma</i> or maritime lowland on the shores of the Red Sea,
  with an elevated inland district of considerable breadth; Hadramaut on
  the south coast; Oman occupying the south-east angle; El-Hasa and Koveït
  on the Persian Gulf; El-Hamad (Desert of Syria), Nefûd, and Jebel Shammar
  in the north; Nejd, the Central Highlands, which occupies a great part of
  the interior of the country, while south of it is the great unexplored
  Dahkna or sandy desert. Between 1902-5 a joint commission of British and
  Turkish officers laid down a boundary line defining the limits between
  Turkish territory and that of the independent Arab tribes in political
  relations with Great Britain. Nearly the whole of Southern Arabia came
  within the sphere of British influence. Madian belongs to Egypt; the
  Hejaz, Yemen, Bahr-el-Hasa, Koveït, &amp;c., were more or less under the
  suzerainty of Turkey until 1914. The rest of the country is ruled by
  independent chiefs&mdash;sheikhs, emirs, and imâms&mdash;while the title
  of sultan has been assumed by the chief of the Wahabis in Nejd, the
  sovereign of Oman (who has a subsidy from the Indian Government), and
  some petty princes in the south of the peninsula. On 9th June, 1916, the
  Grand Shereef of Mecca declared himself independent of the Turkish
  Government, and an Arab revolt spread rapidly. The Grand Shereef Hussein
  then announced to the Moslem world that the Shereefate of Mecca was
  henceforth independent, and on 4th Nov., 1916, he had himself formally
  proclaimed King, or Sultan, of Arabia. The status of the whole of Arabia
  was determined by the Peace Conference. (See <i>Hejaz</i>,
  <i>Mesopotamia</i>, <i>Syria</i>, <i>Sykes-Picot Treaty</i>.) The chief
  towns are Mecca, the birthplace of Mahomet; Medina, the place to which he
  fled from Mecca (<span class="scac">A.D.</span> 622), and where he is
  buried; Hodeida, a seaport exporting Mocha coffee; <!-- Page 212 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page212"></a>[212]</span>Aden, on the <span
  class="scac">S.W.</span> coast, belonging to Britain; Sana, the capital
  of Yemen; and Muscat, the capital of Oman. The chief towns of the
  interior are Haïl, the residence of the Emir of Jebel Shammar; Oneizah,
  under the same ruler; and Rijadh, capital of Nejd and Hasa. The most
  flourishing portions of Arabia are in Oman, Hadramaut, and Nejd. In the
  two former are localities with numerous towns and villages and settled
  industrious populations like that of India or Europe.</p>

  <p>The climate of Arabia in general is marked by extreme heat and
  dryness. Aridity and barrenness characterize both high and low grounds,
  and the date-palm is often the only representative of vegetable
  existence. There are districts which in the course of the year are hardly
  refreshed by a single shower of rain. Forests there are few or none.
  Grassy pastures have their place supplied by steppe-like tracts, which
  are covered for a short season with aromatic herbs, serving as food for
  cattle. The date-palm furnishes the staple article of food; the cereals
  are wheat, barley, maize, and millet; various sorts of fruit flourish;
  coffee and many aromatic plants and substances, such as gum-arabic,
  benzoin, mastic, balsam, aloes, myrrh, frankincense, &amp;c., are
  produced. There are also cultivated in different parts of the peninsula,
  according to the soil and climate, beans, rice, lentils, tobacco, melons,
  saffron, colocynth, poppies, olives, &amp;c. Sheep, goats, oxen, the
  horse, the camel, ass, and mule supply man's domestic and personal wants.
  Among wild animals are gazelles, ostriches, the lion, panther, hyena,
  jackal, &amp;c. Among mineral products are saltpetre, mineral pitch,
  petroleum, salt, sulphur, and several precious stones, as the carnelian,
  agate, and onyx. The people of Arabia, according to their own traditions,
  are derived from two stocks, the pure Arabs and the naturalized Arabs or
  Mustarab. They are leading either a settled agricultural life or a
  nomadic existence. In Southern Arabia the Jews form a large element in
  the towns' population. Commerce is largely in the hands of foreigners,
  among whom the Jews and Banians (Indian merchants) are the most
  numerous.</p>

  <p>The history of Arabia previous to Mahomet is obscure. The earliest
  inhabitants are believed to have been of the Semitic race. Jews in great
  numbers migrated into Arabia after the destruction of Jerusalem, and,
  making numerous proselytes, indirectly favoured the introduction of the
  doctrines of Mahomet. With his advent the Arabians revolted and united
  for the purpose of extending the new creed; and under the
  caliphs&mdash;the successors of Mahomet&mdash;they attained great power,
  and founded large and powerful kingdoms in three continents. (See
  <i>Caliphs</i>.) On the fall of the caliphate of Bagdad in 1258 the
  decline set in, and on the expulsion of the Moors from Spain the foreign
  rule of the Arabs came to an end. In the sixteenth century Turkey subdued
  Hejaz and Yemen, and received the nominal submission of the tribes
  inhabiting the rest of Arabia. The allegiance of Hejaz was renounced
  early in the European War; but Yemen achieved its independence in the
  seventeenth century, and maintained it till 1871, when the territory
  again fell into the hands of the Turks. In 1839 Aden was occupied by the
  British. Oman early became virtually independent of the caliphs, and grew
  into a well-organized kingdom. In 1507 its capital, Maskat or Muscat, was
  occupied by the Portuguese, who were not driven out till 1659. The
  Wahabis appeared towards the end of the eighteenth century, and took an
  important part in the political affairs of Arabia, but their progress was
  interrupted by Mohammed Ali, pasha of Egypt, and they suffered a complete
  defeat by Ibrahim Pasha. He extended his power over most of the country,
  but the events of 1840 in Syria compelled him to renounce all claims to
  Arabia. The Hejaz thus again became subject to Turkish sway, and until
  1914 Turkey continually extended its rule not only over Yemen, but also
  over the district of El-Hasa on the Persian Gulf.&mdash;<span

  Infelix</i>; S.&nbsp;M. Zwemer, <i>Arabia, the Cradle of Islam.</i></p>

  <p><i>Arabian Language and Literature.</i>&mdash;The Arabic language
  belongs to the Semitic dialects, among which it is distinguished for its
  richness, softness, and high degree of development. By the spread of
  Islam it became the sole written language and the prevailing speech in
  all South-Western Asia and Eastern and Northern Africa, and for a time in
  Southern Spain, in Malta, and in Sicily; and it is still used as a
  learned and sacred language wherever Islam is spread. Almost a third part
  of the Persian vocabulary consists of Arabic words, and there is the same
  proportion of Arabic in Turkish. The Arabic language is written in an
  alphabet of its own, which has also been adopted in writing Persian,
  Hindustani, Turkish, &amp;c. As in all Semitic languages (except the
  Ethiopic), it is read from right to left. The vowels are usually omitted
  in Arabic manuscripts, only the consonants being written.</p>

  <p>Poetry among the Arabs had a very early development, and before the
  time of Mahomet poetical contests were held and prizes awarded for the
  best pieces. The collection called the <i>Moallakât</i> contains seven
  pre-Mahommedan poems by seven authors. Many other poems belonging to the
  time before Mahomet, some <!-- Page 213 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page213"></a>[213]</span>of equal age with those of the
  <i>Moallakât</i>, are also preserved in collections. Mahomet gave a new
  direction to Arab literature. The rules of faith and life which he laid
  down were collected by Abu-Bekr, first caliph after his death, and
  published by Othman, the third caliph, and constitute the
  <i>Koran</i>&mdash;the Mahommedan Bible. The progress of the Arabs in
  literature, the arts and sciences, may be said to have begun with the
  government of the caliphs of the family of the Abbassides, <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 749, at Bagdad, several of whom, as Harun al
  Rashid and Al Mamun, were munificent patrons of learning: and their
  example was followed by the Ommiades in Spain. In Spain were established
  numerous academies and schools, which were visited by students from other
  European countries; and important works were written on geography,
  history, philosophy, medicine, physics, mathematics, arithmetic,
  geometry, and astronomy. Most of the geography in the Middle Ages is the
  work of the Arabs, and their historians since the eighth century have
  been very numerous. The philosophy of the Arabs was of Greek origin, and
  derived principally from that of Aristotle. Numerous translations of the
  scientific works of Aristotle and other Greek philosophers were made,
  principally by Christian scholars who resided as physicians at the Courts
  of the caliphs. These were diligently studied in Bagdad, Damascus, and
  Cordova, and, being translated into Latin, became known in the west of
  Europe. Of their philosophical authors the most celebrated are Alfarabi
  (tenth century), Ibn Sina or Avicenna (died <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1037), Alghazzali (died 1111), Ibn Roshd or
  Averroes (twelfth century), called by pre-eminence The Commentator,
  &amp;c. In medicine they excelled all other nations in the Middle Ages,
  and they are commonly regarded as the earliest experimenters in
  chemistry. Their mathematics and astronomy were based on the works of
  Greek writers, but the former they enriched, simplified, and extended. It
  was by them that algebra was introduced to the Western peoples, and the
  Arabic numerals were similarly introduced. Astronomy they especially
  cultivated, for which famous schools and observatories were erected at
  Bagdad and Cordova. The <i>Almagest</i> of Ptolemy in an Arabic
  translation was early a textbook among them. Alongside of science poetry
  continued to be cultivated, but after the ninth or tenth centuries it
  grew more and more artificial. Among poets were Abu Nowas, Asmai, Abu
  Temmam, Motenabbi, Abul-Ala, Busiri, Tograi, and Hariri. Tales and
  romances in prose and verse were written. The tales of fairies, genii,
  enchanters, and sorcerers in particular passed from the Arabians to the
  Western nations, as in <i>The Thousand and One Nights.</i> Some of the
  books most widely read in the Middle Ages, such as <i>The Seven Wise
  Masters,</i> the <i>Fables of Pilpay</i> (or Bidpai), and the <i>Romance
  of Antar</i> found their way into Europe through the instrumentality of
  the Arabs. At the present day Arabic literature is almost confined to the
  production of commentaries and scholia, discussions on points of dogma
  and jurisprudence, and grammatical works on the classical language. There
  are a few newspapers published in Arabic.&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Arabian Nights</b>, or <b>The Thousand and One Nights</b>, (Ar. Alf
  Layla wa-Layla), a celebrated collection of Eastern tales, based upon an
  old work, called <i>Hazar Afsana</i>, long current in the East, and
  supposed to have been derived by the Arabians from India, through the
  medium of Persia. They were first introduced into Europe in the beginning
  of the eighteenth century by means of the French translation of Antoine
  Galland. Of some of them no original MS. is known to exist; they were
  taken down by Galland from the oral communication of a Syrian friend. The
  story which connects the tales of <i>The Thousand and One Nights</i> is
  as follows: The Sultan Shahriyar, exasperated by the faithlessness of his
  bride, made a law that every one of his future wives should be put to
  death the morning after marriage. At length one of them, Sheherazade, the
  generous daughter of the grand-vizier, succeeded in abolishing the cruel
  custom. By the charm of her stories the fair narrator induced the sultan
  to defer her execution every day till the dawn of another, by breaking
  off in the middle of an interesting tale which she had begun to relate.
  In the form we possess them these tales belong to a comparatively late
  period, though the exact date of their composition is not known. Lane,
  who published a translation of a number of the tales, with valuable
  notes, is of opinion that they took their present form some time between
  1475 and 1525. Sir Richard Burton's complete English translation was
  issued in 16 vols. (1885-8).</p>

  <p><b>Arabian Sea</b>, the part of the Indian Ocean between Arabia and
  India.</p>

  <p><b>Arabic Figures</b>, the characters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0; of
  Indian origin, introduced into Europe by the Moors. They did not come
  into general use till after the invention of printing.</p>

  <p><b>Ara´bi Pasha</b>, Egyptian soldier and revolutionary leader, born
  1839. In Sept., 1881, he headed a military revolt, and was for a time
  virtually dictator of Egypt. Britain interfered, and after a short
  campaign, beginning with the bombardment of Alexandria and ending with
  the <!-- Page 214 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page214"></a>[214]</span>defeat of Arabi at Tel-el-Kebir, he
  surrendered, and was banished to Ceylon, being pardoned in 1900. He died
  in obscurity in Cairo in 1911.</p>

  <p><b>Arable Land</b>, land which is fit for ploughing, and capable of
  being cultivated, as distinguished from grass-land, wood-land, common
  pasture, mountains, forests, morasses, and waste. In Government returns
  the term is applied to land that is actually under regular cultivation.
  The land capable of being cultivated amounts in England and Wales to
  about 25 per cent, and in Ireland to about 13 per cent. In the course of
  the last thirty or forty years there has, however, been a considerable
  diminution in the area of land actually cultivated, as a result of large
  foreign imports of grain and other agricultural products.</p>

  <p><b>Arabs.</b> The Arabs, as a race, are of middle stature, of a
  powerful though slender build, and have a skin of a more or less brownish
  colour; in towns and the uplands often almost white. Their features are
  well cut, the nose straight, the forehead high. They are naturally
  active, intelligent, and courteous; and their character is marked by
  temperance, bravery, and hospitality. The first religion of the Arabs,
  the worship of the stars, was supplanted by the doctrines of
  Mahommedanism, which succeeded rapidly in establishing itself throughout
  Arabia. Besides the two principal sects of Islam, the Sunnites and the
  Shiites, there also exists, in considerable numbers, a third Mahommedan
  sect, the Wahabis, which arose in the latter half of the eighteenth
  century, and for a time possessed great political importance in the
  peninsula. The mode of life of the Arabs is either nomadic or settled.
  The nomadic tribes are termed Bedouins (or Bedawins), and among them are
  considered to be the Arabs of the purest blood.</p>

  <p><b>Aracacha</b>, or <b>Arracacha</b> (ar-a-kä'cha), a genus of
  umbelliferous plants of Southern and Central America. The root of <i>A.
  esculenta</i> is divided into several lobes, each of which is about the
  size of a large carrot. These are boiled like potatoes and largely eaten
  in South America.</p>

  <p><b>Aracan</b> (ar-a-kan'), the most northern division of Lower Burmah,
  on the Bay of Bengal; chief town and seaport Akyab. It was ceded to the
  English in 1826, as a result of the first Burmese war.</p>

  State of Ceará, on the River Jaguaribe, about 10 miles from its mouth.
  Exports hides and cotton. Pop. about 10,000.</p>

  <p><b>Ara´ceæ</b>, a nat. ord. of monocotyledonous plants, mostly
  tropical, having the genus Arum as the type. Most of the species have
  tuberous roots abounding in starch, which forms a wholesome food after
  the acrid juice has been washed out. See <i>Arum</i>, <i>Caladium</i>,
  <i>Dumb-cane</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Arachis</b> (ar´a-kis), a genus of leguminous plants much
  cultivated in warm climates, and esteemed a valuable article of food. The
  most remarkable feature of the genus is that when the flower falls the
  stalk supporting the small undeveloped fruit lengthens, and bending
  towards the ground pushes the fruit into the ground, when it begins to
  enlarge and ripen. The pod of <i>A. hypog&oelig;a</i> (popularly called
  ground, earth, or pea nut) is of a pale-yellow colour, and contains two
  seeds the size of a hazel-nut, in flavour sweet as almonds, and yielding
  when pressed an excellent oil.</p>

  <p><b>Arachnida</b> (a-rak´ni-da; Gr. <i>arachn&#x113;</i>, a spider), a
  class of Arthropoda or higher Annulose animals including the Spiders,
  Scorpions, Mites, Ticks, &amp;c. They have the body divided into a number
  of segments or <i>somites</i>, some of which have always articulated
  appendages (limbs, &amp;c.). There is often a pair of nervous ganglia in
  each somite, although in some forms (as spiders) the nervous system
  becomes modified and concentrated. They are oviparous and somewhat
  resemble insects, but they have a united head and thorax, and do not
  undergo a metamorphosis similar to insects. They respire by tracheæ, by
  pulmonary sacs, or by the skin.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´ack</b>, or <b>Ar´rack</b>, a spirituous liquor manufactured in
  the East Indies from a great variety of substances. It is often distilled
  from fermented rice, or it may be distilled from the juice of the
  coco-nut and other palms. Pure arack is clear and transparent, of a
  yellowish or straw colour, and with a peculiar but agreeable taste and
  smell; it contains at least 52 to 54 per cent of alcohol.</p>

  <p><b>Arad</b> (o'rod), a town of the former kingdom of Hungary, on the
  Maros, 30 miles north of Temeswar, divided by the river into O (Old) Arad
  and Uj (New) Arad, connected by a bridge; it has a fortress, and is an
  important railway centre, with a large trade and manufactures. The town
  is now within the confines of Roumania, Uj Arad being called Arodul Neo.
  Population of Old and New Arad together, 63,166.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´adus</b> (now <b>Ruad</b>), an inlet about a mile in
  circumference lying 2 miles off the Syrian coast, 35 miles <span
  class="scac">N.</span> of Tripolis; the site of the Ph&oelig;nician
  stronghold Arvad, a city second only to Tyre and Sidon; now occupied by
  about 3000 people, mainly fishermen.</p>

  <p><b>Arafat´</b>, or <b>Jebel er Rahmeh</b> ('Mountain of Mercy'), a
  hill in Arabia, about 200 feet high, with stone steps reaching to the
  summit, 15 miles south-east of Mecca; one of the principal objects of
  pilgrimage among Mahommedans, who <!-- Page 215 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page215"></a>[215]</span>say that it was the
  place where Adam first received his wife Eve after they had been expelled
  from Paradise and separated from each other 120 years. A sermon delivered
  on the mount constitutes one great ceremony of the <i>Hajj</i>; or
  pilgrimage to Mecca, and entitles the hearer to the name and privileges
  of a <i>Hajji</i> or pilgrim.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´ago</b>, Dominique François, a French physicist, born in 1786,
  died at Paris in 1853. After studying in the Polytechnic School at Paris,
  he was appointed a secretary of the Bureau des Longitudes. In 1806 he was
  associated with Biot in completing in Spain the measurements of Delambre
  and Méchain to obtain an arc of the meridian. Before he got back to
  France he had been shipwrecked and narrowly escaped being enslaved at
  Algiers. In 1809 he was elected to the Academy of Sciences and appointed
  a professor at the Polytechnic School. He distinguished himself by his
  researches in the polarization of light, galvanism, magnetism, astronomy,
  &amp;c. His discovery of the magnetic properties of substances devoid of
  iron, made known to the Academy of Sciences in 1824, procured him the
  Copley medal of the Royal Society of London in 1825. A further
  consideration of the same subject led to the equally remarkable discovery
  of the production of magnetism by electricity. He took part in the
  revolution of 1848, and held the office of Minister of War and Marine in
  the provisional Government. At the <i>coup d'état</i> of Dec., 1852, he
  refused to take the oath to the Government of Louis Napoleon, but the
  oath was not pressed. His works, which were posthumously collected and
  published, consist, besides his <i>Astronomie Populaire</i>, chiefly of
  contributions to learned societies, and biographical notices
  (<i>éloges</i>) of deceased members of the Academy of Sciences.</p>

  <p><b>Arago</b>, Emmanuel, son of Dominique François, French advocate and
  politician, was born at Paris in 1812; called to the bar 1837; took part
  in the revolution of 1848; renounced politics after the <i>coup
  d'état</i> of Dec., 1852, but continued to practise at the bar. After the
  fall of the Empire he again took a prominent part in public affairs, and
  held several important offices. He is author of a volume of poems and
  many theatrical pieces. He died in 1896.</p>

  <p><b>Arago</b>, Étienne, brother of Dominique Arago, born 1802, died
  1892. He founded the journals <i>La Réforme</i> and <i>Le Figaro</i>; was
  director of the Théâtre du Vaudeville, 1829; took part in the revolution
  of 1848; was condemned to transportation, 1849; fled from France, but
  returned in 1859; was mayor of Paris during the Franco-Prussian war, and
  appointed archivist to the École des Beaux Arts, 1878. He was author of
  upwards of 100 dramas, <i>La Vie de Molière,</i> <i>Les Bleus et les
  Blancs</i>, and other works.</p>

  <p><b>Ara´lia</b>, a genus of plants with small flowers arranged in
  umbels and succulent berries, the type of the nat. ord. Araliaceæ, which
  is nearly related to the Umbelliferæ, but the species are of a more
  shrubby habit. They are natives chiefly of tropical or sub-tropical
  countries, and in Britain are represented by the ivy; ginseng belongs to
  the order. From the pith of <i>A. papyrif&#x115;ra</i> is obtained the

  <p><b>A´ram</b>, Eugene, a self-taught scholar whose unhappy fate has
  been made the subject of a ballad by Hood and a romance by Lord Lytton,
  was born in Yorkshire, 1704, executed for murder, 1759. In 1734 he set up
  a school at Knaresborough. About 1745 a shoemaker of that place, named
  Daniel Clarke, was suddenly missing under suspicious circumstances; and
  no light was thrown on the matter till full thirteen <!-- Page 216
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page216"></a>[216]</span>years
  afterwards, when an expression dropped by one Richard Houseman,
  respecting the discovery of a skeleton supposed to be Clarke's, caused
  him to be taken into custody. From his confession an order was issued for
  the apprehension of Aram, who had long quitted Yorkshire, and was at the
  time acting as usher at the grammar-school at Lynn. He was brought to
  trial on 3rd Aug., 1759, at York, where, notwithstanding an able and
  eloquent defence which he made before the court, he was convicted of the
  murder of Clarke, and sentenced to death. He was among the first to
  recognize the affinity of the Celtic to the other European languages, and
  under favourable circumstances might have done some valuable work in
  philological science.&mdash;Cf. W. Bristow, <i>The Genuine Account of the

  </div>

  <p><b>Arauca´ria</b>, a genus of trees of the coniferous or pine order,
  indigenous to Australasia and South America. The species are large
  evergreen trees with pretty large, stiff, flattened, and <!-- Page 217
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page217"></a>[217]</span>generally
  imbricated leaves, verticillate spreading branches, and bearing large
  cones, each scale having a single large seed. The species <i>A.
  imbric&#x101;ta</i> (the Chile pine or monkey-puzzle), with hard, sharp,
  pointed leaves, was introduced into Britain in 1796. It is a native of
  the mountains of Southern Chile, where it forms vast forests and yields a
  hard durable wood. Its seeds are eaten when roasted. The Moreton Bay pine
  of New South Wales (<i>A. Cunninghamii</i>) supplies a valuable timber
  used in house and boat building, in making furniture, and in other
  carpenter work. A species, <i>A. excelsa</i>, or Norfolk Island pine,
  abounds in several of the South Sea Islands, where it attains a height of
  220 feet with a circumference of 30 feet, and is described as one of the
  most beautiful of trees. Its foliage is light and graceful, and quite
  unlike that of <i>A. imbricata</i>, having nothing of its stiff
  formality. Its timber is of some value, being white, tough, and
  close-grained.</p>

  <p><b>Arbitra´tion</b>, the hearing and determination of a cause between
  parties in controversy, by a person or persons chosen by the parties.
  This may be done by one person, but it is common to choose more than one.
  Frequently two are nominated, one by each party, with a third, the
  <i>umpire</i> (or, in Scotland, sometimes the <i>oversman</i>), who is
  called on to decide in case of the primary arbitrators differing. In such
  a case the umpire may be agreed upon either by the parties themselves, or
  by the arbitrators when they have received authority from the parties to
  the dispute to settle this point. The determination of arbitrators is
  called an <i>award</i>. By the law of England the authority of an
  arbitrator cannot be revoked by any of the parties without the leave of
  the court or of a judge.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>:

  the annual planting of trees by the people, and especially by
  school-children. The custom was instituted in 1872.</p>

  <p><b>Arbore´tum</b> (Lat. <i>arbor</i>, a tree), a place in which a
  collection of different trees and shrubs is cultivated for scientific or
  educational purposes. The largest arboretum in Britain, perhaps the
  finest in the whole world, is that of the Royal Gardens, at Kew,
  inaugurated in 1762, to which 180 acres are now devoted. Next in
  celebrity <!-- Page 218 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  and at Dublin (Glasnevin), the Botanical Gardens at Oxford, and the
  Botanic Gardens at Glasgow. Other arboreta are that of the Jardin des
  Plantes, Paris, and the Arnold Arboretum, at Jamaica Plain, Boston. The
  term arboretum has also been applied in a restricted sense, as in the
  <i>Arboretum Fruticetum Britannicum</i>, the monumental work by J.&nbsp;C.
  Loudon.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´boriculture</b> includes the culture of trees and shrubs, as
  well as all that pertains to the preparation of the soil, the sowing of
  the seeds, and the treatment of the plants in their young state, the
  preparation of the land previous to their final transplantation, their
  just adaptation to soil and situation, their relative growth and progress
  to maturity, their management during growth, and the proper season and
  period for felling them.</p>

  <p><b>Arbor Vitæ</b> (literally, 'tree of life'), the name of several
  coniferous trees of the genus Thuja, allied to the cypress, with
  flattened branchlets, and small imbricated or scale-like leaves. The name
  is derived from valuable medicinal properties having formerly been
  ascribed to the aromatic resin they mostly yield. Those generally
  cultivated in Britain are: the common Arbor Vitæ (<i>Thuja
  occident&#x101;lis</i>), a native of North America, where it grows to a
  height of 40 or 50 feet, introduced into Britain about 1566; the giant
  Arbor Vitæ or Red Cedar (<i>Thuja gigantea</i>), introduced in 1854; and
  the Chinese Arbor Vitæ (<i>Thuja orient&#x101;lis</i>).</p>

  municipal and police burgh and seaport in the county of Forfar, Scotland,
  at the mouth of the small River Brothock. Its ancient abbey, founded by
  William the Lion in 1178, and dedicated to Saints Mary and Thomas à
  Becket, is now a picturesque ruin. There are numerous flax and hemp
  spinning-mills and factories, and much canvas and linen is made; also
  tanning, shoemaking, and fishing, and a small shipping trade, but the
  harbour is bad. Pop. 19,499. It unites with Montrose, Forfar, Brechin,
  and Inverbervie (the Montrose burghs) in sending a member to
  Parliament.</p>

  <p><b>Arbuth´not</b>, John, an eminent physician and distinguished wit,
  born at Arbuthnot, Kincardineshire, Scotland, 1667, died 1735. He
  received the degree of Doctor of Medicine at the University of St.
  Andrews, and went to London, where he soon distinguished himself by his
  writings and by his skill in his profession. In 1704 he was chosen Fellow
  of the Royal Society, and soon after he was appointed physician
  extraordinary, and then physician in ordinary to Queen Anne. About this
  time he became intimate with Swift, Pope, Gay, and other wits of the day.
  His writings, other than professional or scientific, include his
  contributions (in conjunction with Swift and Pope) to the <i>Memoirs of
  Martinus Scriblerus</i>, <i>History of John Bull</i>, <i>Art of Political
  Lying</i>, &amp;c. He was conspicuous not only for learning and wit, but
  also for worth and humanity.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´butus</b>, a genus of plants belonging to the Ericaceæ, or heath
  order, and comprising a number of small trees and shrubs, natives chiefly
  of Europe and N. America. <i>Arb&#x16D;tus Un&#x115;do</i> abounds near
  the lakes of Killarney, where its fine foliage adds charms to the
  scenery. The bright red or yellow berries, somewhat like the strawberry,
  have an unpleasant taste and narcotic properties. The Corsicans make wine
  from them. The trailing arbutus or may-flower of N. America, a plant with
  fragrant and beautiful blossoms, is <i>Epigæa repens</i>, of the same
  nat. ord.</p>

  <p><b>Arc</b>, a portion of a curved line, especially of a circle. It is
  by means of circular arcs that all angles are

  landlocked basin of Arcachon, a much-frequented bathing-place, with great
  oyster-breeding establishments. It is connected by railway with Bordeaux.
  Pop. 10,266.</p>

  <p><b>Arcade</b>, a series of arches supported on piers or pillars, used
  generally as a screen and support of a roof, or of the wall of a
  building, and having beneath the covered part an ambulatory as round a
  cloister, or a footpath with shops or dwellings, as frequently seen in
  old Italian towns. Sometimes a porch or other prominent part of an
  important building is treated with arcades. At the present day Bologna,
  Padua, and Berne have fine examples of mediæval arcaded streets, and
  among more modern work various streets in Turin, and the Rue de Rivoli,
  Paris, are lined with arcades, with shops underneath. In mediæval
  architecture the term arcade is also applied to a series of arches
  supported on pillars forming an ornamental dressing or enrichment of a
  wall, a mode of treatment of very frequent occurrence in the towers,
  apses, and other parts of churches. In modern use the name arcade is
  often applied to a passage or narrow street containing shops arched over
  and covered with glass, as for example the Burlington Arcade, London, the
  Royal Arcade at Newcastle, and the Gallería Vittorio Emmanuele in Milan.

  discourse), the study of antiquity, or the science which takes cognizance
  of the history of nations and peoples as evinced by the remains,
  architectural, implemental, or otherwise, which belong to the earlier
  epoch of their existence. In a more extended sense the term embraces
  every branch of knowledge which bears on the origin, religion, laws,
  languages, science, arts, and literature of ancient peoples. It is to a
  great extent synonymous with <i>prehistoric annals</i>, as a large if not
  the principal part of its field of study extends over those periods in
  the history of the human race in regard to which we possess almost no
  information derivable from written records. Archæology divides the
  primeval period of the human race, more especially as exhibited by
  remains found in Europe, into the <i>stone</i>, the <i>bronze</i>, and
  the <i>iron</i> ages, these names being given in accordance with the
  materials employed for weapons, implements, &amp;c., during the
  particular period. The <i>stone</i> age has been subdivided into the
  <i>palæolithic</i> and <i>neolithic</i>, the former being that older
  period, in which the stone implements were not polished as they are in
  the latter and more recent period. The <i>bronze</i> age, which admits of
  a similar subdivision, is that in which implements were of copper or
  bronze. In this age the dead were burned and their ashes deposited in
  urns or stone chests, covered with conical mounds of earth or cairns of
  stones. Gold and amber ornaments appear in this age. The <i>iron</i> age
  is that in which implements, &amp;c., of iron begin to appear, although
  stone and bronze implements are found along with them. The word
  <i>age</i> in this sense (as explained under <i>Age</i>) simply denotes
  the stage at which a people has arrived. The phrase stone age, therefore,
  merely marks the period before the use of bronze, the bronze age that
  before the employment of iron, among any specific people. See

  <p><b>Archbishop</b> (ärch-), a chief bishop, or bishop over other
  bishops; a metropolitan prelate. The establishment of this dignity is to
  be traced up to an early period of Christianity, when the bishops and
  inferior clergy met in the capitals to deliberate on spiritual affairs,
  and the bishop of the city where the meeting was held presided. In
  England there are two archbishops&mdash;those of Canterbury and York; the
  former styled <!-- Page 221 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page221"></a>[221]</span><i>Primate of all England</i>, the latter
  <i>Primate of England</i>. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the first peer
  of the realm, having precedence before all great officers of the Crown
  and all dukes not of royal birth. He crowns the sovereign, and when he is
  invested with his archbishopric he is said to be enthroned. He can grant
  special licences to marry at any time or place, and can confer degrees
  otherwise to be obtained only from the universities. He is addressed by
  the titles of <i>your grace</i> and <i>most reverend father in God</i>,
  and writes himself <i>by divine providence</i>, while the Archbishop of
  York and the bishops only write <i>by divine permission</i>. The first
  Archbishop of Canterbury was Augustine, appointed <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 598 by Ethelbert. Next in dignity is the
  Archbishop of York, between whom and the Archbishop of Canterbury the
  Lord High-Chancellor of England has his place in precedency. The first
  Archbishop of York was Paulinus, appointed in 622. The incomes of the
  sees are £15,000 and £10,000 respectively. An Archbishop of Wales was
  first appointed in 1920. Scotland had two archbishops&mdash;St. Andrews
  and Glasgow. Ireland had four, but the Episcopal Church has but
  two&mdash;Armagh and Dublin, the former being <i>Primate of all
  Ireland</i>, the latter <i>Primate of Ireland</i>. There are four Roman
  Catholic archbishops in England and Wales&mdash;Westminster, Cardiff,
  Birmingham, and Liverpool; two in Scotland&mdash;St. Andrews and
  Edinburgh, and Glasgow; four in Ireland&mdash;Armagh, Dublin, Cashel, and
  Tuam.</p>

  <p><b>Archdeacon</b> (ärch-), in England, an ecclesiastical dignitary
  next in rank below a bishop, having a certain jurisdiction over a part of
  the diocese. From two to four archdeacons are appointed by the bishops,
  under whom they perform their duties, and they hold courts which decide
  cases subject to an appeal to the bishop.</p>

  <p><b>Archduke</b>, a title peculiar to the royal family of
  Austria&mdash;the Habsburgs, who ruled until 1918.</p>

  <p><b>Archelaus</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>r-k&#x113;-l&#x101;´us), the name of
  several personages in ancient history, one of whom was the son of Herod
  the Great. He received from Augustus the sovereignty of Judea, Samaria,
  and Idumea. The people, tired of his tyrannical and bloody reign, accused
  him before Augustus, who banished him to Gaul.</p>

  <p><b>Archer</b>, William, journalist and miscellaneous writer, born at
  Perth, Scotland, in 1856. Educated at Edinburgh University, he went to
  London after some experience of journalism at Edinburgh, and after a
  visit to Australia was called to the bar, and was dramatic critic for
  <i>The World</i> from 1884 to 1905. Subsequently he has been dramatic
  critic for <i>The Tribune</i> and <i>The Nation</i>. He has done much to
  introduce Ibsen to the English public, by translating his dramas and
  otherwise, and has written <i>English Dramatists of To-day</i>; <i>A Life
  of Macready</i>; <i>About the Theatre: Essays and Studies</i>; <i>Masks
  or Faces?: a Study on the Psychology of Acting</i>; <i>The Theatrical
  World</i> (a collection of his dramatic criticisms) (5 vols.); <i>Study

  <p><b>Archer-fish</b>, a name given to the <i>Tox&#x14F;tes
  jacul&#x101;tor</i>, a scaly-finned, acanthopterygian fish, about 6
  inches long, inhabiting the seas around Java, which has the faculty of
  shooting drops of water to the distance of 3 or 4 feet at insects,
  thereby causing them to fall into the water, when it seizes and devours
  them. The soft, and even the spiny portions of their dorsal fins are so
  covered with scales as to be scarcely distinguishable from the rest of
  the body.</p>

  <p><b>Arch´ery</b>, the art of shooting with a bow and arrow. The use of
  these weapons in war and the chase dates from the earliest antiquity.
  Ishmael, we learn from <i>Gen</i>. xxi, "became an archer". The
  Egyptians, Assyrians, Persians, Parthians, excelled in the use of the
  bow; and while the Greeks and Romans themselves made little use of it,
  they employed foreign archers as mercenaries. Coming to much more recent
  times, we find the Swiss famous as archers, but they generally used the
  arbalist or cross-bow, and were no match for their English rivals, who
  preferred the long-bow. (See <i>Bow</i>.) The English victories of
  Cressy, Poietiers, and Agincourt, gained against apparently overwhelming
  odds, may be ascribed to the bowmen. Archery disappeared gradually as
  firearms came into use, and as an instrument of war or the chase the bow
  is now confined to the most savage tribes of both hemispheres. But though
  the bow has been long abandoned among <!-- Page 222 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page222"></a>[222]</span>civilized nations as a
  military weapon, it is still cherished as an instrument of healthful
  recreation, encouraged by archery clubs or societies, which have been
  established in many parts of Britain. The oldest, and by far the most
  historically important of these societies, is the Royal Company of
  Archers, called also the King's Body-guard for Scotland, formed
  originally, it is said, by James I, but constituted in its present form
  by an Act of the Privy Council of Scotland, in 1676, and having its
  head-quarters in Edinburgh, counting among its members many of the
  nobility and gentry of the northern kingdom, and holding annual meetings,
  where prizes are competed for. In recent years a number of clubs have
  been formed in the United States. Archery has the merit of forming a
  sport open to women as well as men.&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Arches, Court of,</b> the chief and most ancient consistory court,
  belonging to the archbishopric of Canterbury, for the debating of
  spiritual causes. It is named from the church in London, St. Mary le Bow,
  or Bow Church (so called from a fine <i>arched</i> crypt), where it was
  formerly held. The jurisdiction of this court extends over the province
  of Canterbury. The office of president or dean is now merged in that of
  the judge appointed by the Public Worship Regulation Act (1874). The
  court now sits in the library of Lambeth Palace.</p>

  <p><b>Archil,</b> or <b>Orchil</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>r´kil, or´kil), a red, violet, or purple
  colouring matter obtained from various kinds of lichens, the most
  important of which are the <i>Roccella tinctoria</i> and the <i>R.
  fuciformis</i>, natives of the rocks of the Canary and Cape Verde
  Islands, Mozambique and Zanzibar, South America, &amp;c., and popularly
  called dyer's-moss. The dye is used for improving the tints of other
  dyes, as from its want of permanence it cannot be employed alone; but the
  aniline colours have largely superseded it. Cudbear and litmus are of
  similar origin.</p>

  <p><b>Archilochus</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>r-kil´o-kus) <b>of Paros,</b> one of the
  earliest Ionian lyric poets, the first Greek poet who composed iambic
  verses according to fixed rules. He flourished about 700 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> His iambic poems were renowned for force of
  style, liveliness of metaphor, and a powerful but bitter spirit of
  satire. In other lyric poems of a graver character he was also considered
  as a model. All his works are lost but a few fragments.</p>

  <p><b>Archiman´drite,</b> in the Greek Church, an abbot or abbot-general,
  who has the superintendence of many abbots and convents. The title dates
  from the fourth century.</p>

  <p><b>Archime´dean Screw,</b> a machine for raising water, said to have
  been invented by Archimedes. It is formed by winding a tube spirally
  round a cylinder so as to have the form of a screw, or by hollowing out
  the cylinder itself into a double or triple-threaded screw and enclosing
  it in a water-tight case. When the screw is placed in an inclined
  position and the lower end immersed in water, by causing the screw to
  revolve, the water may be raised to a limited extent.</p>

  <p><b>Archimedes</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>r-ki-m&#x113;´d&#x113;z), a celebrated
  ancient Greek physicist and geometrician, born at Syracuse, in Sicily,
  about 287 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> He devoted himself entirely to
  science, and enriched mathematics with discoveries of the highest
  importance, upon which the moderns have founded their admeasurements of
  curvilinear surfaces and solids. Archimedes is the only one among the
  ancients who has left us anything satisfactory on the theory of mechanics
  and on hydrostatics. He first taught the hydrostatic principle to which
  his name is attached, "that a body immersed in a fluid loses as much in
  weight as the weight of an equal volume of the fluid", and determined by
  means of it that an artist had fraudulently added too much alloy to a
  crown which King Hiero had ordered to be made of pure gold. He discovered
  the solution of this problem while bathing; and it is said to have caused
  him so much joy that he hastened home from the bath undressed, and crying
  out, <i>Eur&#x113;ka! Eur&#x113;ka!</i> 'I have found it, I have found
  it!' Practical mechanics also received a great deal of attention from
  Archimedes, who boasted that if he had a fulcrum or stand-point he could
  move the world. He is the inventor of the compound pulley, probably of
  the endless screw, the Archimedean screw, &amp;c. During the siege of
  Syracuse by the Romans he is said to have constructed many wonderful
  machines with which he repelled their attacks, and he is stated to have
  set on fire their fleet by burning-glasses. At the moment when the <!--
  Page 223 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page223"></a>[223]</span>Romans gained possession of the city by
  assault (212 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), tradition relates that
  Archimedes was slain while sitting in the market-place contemplating some
  mathematical figures which he had drawn in the sand.</p>

  <p><b>Archipel´ago</b>, a term originally applied to the Ægean, the sea
  lying between Greece and Asia Minor, then to the numerous islands
  situated therein, and subsequently to any cluster of islands. In the
  Grecian Archipelago the islands nearest the European coast lie together
  almost in a circle, and for this reason are called the <i>Cyclades</i>
  (Gr. <i>kyklos</i>, a circle); those nearest the Asiatic, being farther
  from one another, the <i>Sporades</i> ('scattered'). (See these articles,
  and <i>Negropont</i>, <i>Scio</i>, <i>Samos</i>, <i>Rhodes</i>,
  <i>Cyprus</i>, &amp;c.) The Malay, Indian, or Eastern Archipelago, on the
  east of Asia, includes Borneo, Sumatra, and other large islands.</p>

  <p><b>Architec´ture</b>, in a general sense, is the art of designing and
  constructing houses, bridges, and other buildings for the purposes of
  civil life; or, in a more limited but very common sense, that branch of
  the fine arts which has for its object the production of edifices not
  only convenient for their special purpose, but characterized by unity,
  beauty, and often grandeur.&mdash;The first habitations of man were such
  as nature afforded, or cost little labour to the occupant&mdash;caves,
  huts, and tents. But as soon as men rose in civilization and formed
  settled societies they began to build more commodious and comfortable
  habitations. They bestowed more care on the materials, preparing bricks
  of clay or earth, which they at first dried in the air, but afterwards
  baked by fire; and subsequently they smoothed stones and joined them at
  first without, and at a later period with, mortar or cement. After they
  had learned to build houses, they erected temples for their gods on a
  larger and more splendid scale than their own dwellings. The Egyptians
  are the most ancient nation known to us among whom architecture had
  attained the character of a fine art. Other ancient peoples among whom it
  had made great progress were the Babylonians, whose most celebrated
  buildings were temples, palaces, and hanging gardens; the Assyrians,
  whose capital, Nineveh, was rich in splendid buildings; the
  Ph&oelig;nicians, whose cities, Sidon, Tyre, &amp;c., were adorned with
  equal magnificence; and the Israelites, whose temple was a wonder of
  architecture. But comparatively few architectural monuments of these
  nations have remained till our day.</p>

  <p>This is not the case with the architecture of Egypt, however, of which
  we possess ample remains in the shape of pyramids, temples, sepulchres,
  obelisks, &amp;c. Egyptian chronology is far from certain, but the
  greatest of the architectural monuments of the country, the pyramids of
  Ghizeh, are at least as old as 2800 or 2700 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> The Egyptian temples had walls of great
  thickness and sloping on the outside from bottom to top; the roofs were
  flat, and composed of blocks of stone reaching from one wall or column to
  another. The columns were numerous, close, and very thick, generally
  without bases, and exhibiting great variety in the designs of their
  capitals. The principle of the arch, though known, was not employed for
  architectural purposes. Statues of enormous size, sphinxes carved in
  stone, and on the walls sculptures in outline of deities and animals,
  with innumerable hieroglyphics, are the decorative objects which belong
  to this style.</p>

    Egyptian&mdash;Restoration of Temple of Luxor
  </div>

  <p>The earliest architectural remains of Greece are of unknown antiquity,
  and consist of massive walls built of huge blocks of stone. In historic
  times the Greeks developed an architecture of noble simplicity and
  dignity. The discoveries in Crete and Argolis have shown that Greek
  architecture owes much less than was supposed to Egyptian and Chaldæan
  architecture. It is considered to have attained its greatest perfection
  in the age of Pericles, or about 460-430 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>
  The great masters of this period were Phidias, Ictinus, Callicrates,
  &amp;c. All the extant buildings are more or less in ruins. The style is
  characterized by beauty, harmony, and simplicity in the highest degree.
  Distinctive of it are what are called the <i>orders</i> of architecture,
  by which term are understood certain modes of proportioning and
  decorating the column and its superimposed entablature. The Greeks had
  three orders, called respectively the <i>Doric</i>, <i>Ionic</i>, and
  <i>Corinthian</i>. (See articles under these names.) Greek buildings were
  abundantly adorned with sculptures, and painting was extensively used,
  the details of the structures being enriched by different colours or
  tints. Lowness of roofs and the absence of arches were distinctive
  features of Greek architecture, in which, as in that of Egypt,
  horizontality of line is another characteristic mark. The most remarkable
  public edifices of the Greeks were temples, of which the most <!-- Page
  224 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page224"></a>[224]</span>famous is
  the Parthenon at Athens. Others exist in various parts of Greece as well
  as in Sicily, Southern Italy, Asia Minor, &amp;c., where important Greek
  communities were early settled. Their theatres were semicircular on one
  side and square on the other, the semicircular part being usually
  excavated in the side of some convenient hill. This part, the auditorium,
  was filled with concentric seats, and might be capable of containing
  20,000 spectators. A number exist in Greece, Sicily, and Asia Minor, and
  elsewhere. By the end of the Peloponnesian War (<i>c.</i> 400 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>) the best period of Greek architecture was over;
  a noble simplicity had given place to excess of ornament. After the death
  of Alexander the Great (323 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>) the decline
  was still more marked.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Among the Romans there was no original development of architecture as
  among the Greeks, though they early took the foremost place in the
  construction of such works as aqueducts and sewers, the arch being in
  early and extensive use among this people. As a fine art, however, Roman
  architecture had its origin in copies of the Greek models, all the
  Grecian orders being introduced into Rome, and variously modified. Their
  number, moreover, was augmented by the addition of two new
  orders&mdash;the <i>Tuscan</i> and the <i>Composite</i>. The Romans
  became acquainted with the architecture of the Greeks soon after 200
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, but it was not till about two centuries
  later that the architecture of Rome attained (under Augustus) its
  greatest perfection. Among the great works now erected were temples,
  aqueducts, amphitheatres, magnificent villas, triumphal arches,
  monumental pillars, &amp;c. The <i>amphitheatre</i> differed from the
  theatre in being a completely circular or rather elliptical building,
  filled on all sides with ascending seats for spectators and leaving only
  the central space, called the <i>arena</i>, for the combatants and public
  shows. The Coliseum is a stupendous structure of this kind. The
  <i>thermæ</i>, or baths, were vast structures in which multitudes of
  people could bathe at once. Magnificent tombs were often built by the
  wealthy. Remains of private residences are numerous, and the excavations
  at Pompeii in particular have thrown great light on the internal
  arrangements of the Roman dwelling-house. Almost all the successors of
  Augustus embellished Rome more or less, erected splendid palaces and
  temples, and adorned, like Hadrian, even the conquered countries with
  them. But after the period of Hadrian (<span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  117-138) Roman architecture is considered to have been on the decline.
  The refined and noble style of the Greeks was neglected, and there was an
  attempt to embellish the beautiful more and more. This decline was all
  the more rapid at a later time owing to the disturbed state of the Empire
  and the incursions of the barbarians.</p>

  <p>In Constantinople, after its virtual separation from the Western
  Empire, arose a style of art and architecture which was practised by the
  Greek Church during the whole of the Middle Ages. This is called the
  Byzantine style. The church of St. Sophia at Constantinople, built by
  Justinian (reigned 527-565), offers the most typical specimen of the
  style, of which the fundamental principle was an application of the Roman
  arch, the dome being the most striking feature of the building. In the
  most typical examples the dome or cupola rests on four pendentives.</p>

  <p>After the dismemberment of the Roman Empire the beautiful works of
  ancient architecture were almost entirely destroyed by the Goths,
  Vandals, and other barbarians in Italy, Greece, Asia, Spain, and Africa;
  or what was spared by them was ruined by the fanaticism of the
  Christians. A new style of architecture now arose, two forms of which,
  the Lombard and the Norman Romanesque, form important phases of art. The
  Lombard prevailed in North Italy and South Germany from the eighth or
  ninth to the thirteenth century (though the Lombard rule came to an end
  in 774); the Norman Romanesque flourished, especially in Normandy and
  England, from the eleventh to the middle of the thirteenth century. The
  semicircular arch is the most characteristic feature of this style. With
  the Lombard Romanesque were combined Byzantine features, and buildings in
  the pure Byzantine style were also erected in Italy, as the church of St.
  Mark at Venice.</p>

  <p>The conquests of the Moors introduced a fresh <!-- Page 225 --><span

  into Europe after the eighth century&mdash;the Moorish or Saracenic. This
  style accompanied the spread of Mahommedanism after its rise in Arabia in
  the seventh century. The edifices erected by the Moors and Saracens in
  Spain, Egypt, and Turkey are distinguished, among other things, by a
  peculiar form of the arch, which forms a curve constituting more than
  half a circle or ellipse. A peculiar flowery decoration, called
  <i>arabesque</i>, is a common ornament of this style, of which the
  building called the Alhambra (q.v.) is perhaps the chief glory.</p>

  <p>The Germans were unacquainted with architecture until the time of
  Charlemagne. He introduced into Germany the Byzantine and Romanesque
  styles. Afterwards the Moorish or Arabian style had some influence upon
  that of the Western nations, and thus originated the mixed style which
  maintained itself till the middle of the thirteenth century. Then began
  the modern Gothic style, which grew up in France, England, and Germany.
  Its striking characteristics are its pointed arches, its pinnacles and
  spires, its large buttresses, clustered pillars, vaulted roofs, profusion
  of ornament, and, on the whole, its lofty, bold character. Its most
  distinctive feature, as compared with the Greek or the Egyptian style, is
  the predominance in it of perpendicular or rising lines, producing forms
  that convey the idea of soaring or mounting upwards. Its greatest
  capabilities have been best displayed in ecclesiastical edifices. The
  Gothic style is divided into four principal epochs: the Early Pointed, or
  general style of the thirteenth century; the Decorated, or style of the
  fourteenth century; the Perpendicular, practised during the fifteenth and
  early part of the sixteenth centuries; and the Tudor, or general style of
  the sixteenth century. This style lasted in England up to the seventeenth
  century, being gradually displaced by that branch of the Renaissance or
  modified revival of ancient Roman architecture which is known as the
  <i>Elizabethan style</i>, and which is perhaps more purely an English
  style than any other that can be named.</p>

  <p>The rise of the Renaissance style in Italy is the greatest event in
  the history of architecture after the introduction of the Gothic style.
  The Gothic style had been introduced into the country and extensively
  employed, but had never been thoroughly naturalized. The Renaissance is a
  revival of the classic style based on the study of the ancient models;
  and having practically commenced in Florence about the beginning of the
  fifteenth century, it soon spread with great rapidity over Italy and the
  greater part of Europe. The most illustrious architects of this early
  period of the style were Brunelleschi, who built at Florence the dome of
  the cathedral, the Pitti Palace, &amp;c., besides many edifices at Milan,
  Pisa, Pesaro, and Mantua; Alberti, who wrote an important work on
  architecture, and erected many beautiful churches; Bramante, who began
  the building of St. Peter's, Rome, and Michael Angelo, who erected its
  magnificent dome. On St. Peter's were also employed Raphael, Peruzzi, and
  San Gallo. The noblest building in this style of architecture in Britain
  is St. Paul's, London, the work of Sir Christopher Wren.</p>

  <p>Since the Renaissance period there has been no architectural
  development requiring special note. In buildings erected at the present
  day some one of the various styles of architecture is employed according
  to taste. Modern <!-- Page 226 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page226"></a>[226]</span>dwelling-houses have necessarily a style
  of their own as far as stories and apartments and windows and chimneys
  can give them one. In general the Grecian style, as handed down by Rome
  and modified by the Italian architects of the Renaissance, from its right
  angles and straight entablatures, is more convenient, and fits better
  with the distribution of our common buildings, than the pointed and
  irregular Gothic. But the occasional introduction of the Gothic outline
  and the partial employment of its ornaments has undoubtedly an agreeable
  effect both in public and private edifices; and we are indebted to it,
  among other things, for the spire, a structure exclusively Gothic, which,
  though often misplaced, has become an object of general approbation and a
  pleasing landmark to cities and villages. The works most characteristic
  of the present day are the large bridges, viaducts, &amp;c., in many of
  which iron is the sole or most characteristic portion of the
  material.</p>

  <p>A few words may be added on the architecture of India and China.
  Although many widely-differing styles are to be found in India, the
  oldest and only true native style of Indian ecclesiastical architecture
  is the Buddhist, the earliest specimens dating from 250 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> Among the chief objects of Buddhist art are
  <i>stupas</i> or <i>topes</i>, built in the form of large towers, and
  employed as <i>dágobas</i> to contain relics of Buddha or of some noted
  saint. Other works of Buddhist art are temples or monasteries excavated
  from the solid rock, and supported by pillars of the natural rock left in
  their places. Buddhist architecture is found in Ceylon, Tibet, Java,
  &amp;c., as well as in India. The most remarkable Hindu or Brahmanical
  temples are in Southern India. They are pyramidal in form, rising in a
  series of stories. The Saracenic or Mohammedan architecture afterwards
  introduced into India is, of course, of foreign origin. The Chinese have
  made the <i>tent</i> the elementary feature of their architecture; and of
  their style any one may form an idea by inspecting the figures which are
  depicted upon common chinaware. Chinese roofs are concave on the upper
  side, as if made of canvas instead of wood. (For further information see

  <p><b>Arctic</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>rk´tik), an epithet given to the north
  pole from the proximity of the constellation of the Bear, in Greek called
  <i>arktos</i>. The <i>Arctic Circle</i> is an imaginary circle on the
  globe, parallel to the equator, and 23° 28´ distant from the north pole.
  This and its opposite, the <i>Antarctic</i>, are called the two polar
  circles.</p>

  <p><b>Arctic Expeditions.</b> See <i>North Polar Expeditions</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Arctic Ocean</b>, that part of the water surface of the earth which
  surrounds the north pole, and washes the northern shores of Europe, Asia,
  and America; its southern boundary roughly coinciding with the Arctic
  Circle (lat. 66° 30´ <span class="scac">N.</span>). It encloses many
  large islands, and contains large bays and gulfs which deeply indent the
  northern shores of the three continents. Its great characteristic is ice,
  which is perpetual nearly everywhere.</p>

  <p><b>Arctic Regions</b>, the regions round the north pole, and extending
  from the pole on all sides to the Arctic Circle in lat. 66° 30´ <span
  class="scac">N.</span> The Arctic or North Polar Circle just touches the
  northern headlands of Iceland, cuts off the southern and narrowest
  portion of Greenland, crosses Fox's Strait north of Hudson's Bay, whence
  it goes over the American continent to Behring's Strait. Thence it runs
  to Obdorsk at the mouth of the Obi, then crossing Northern Russia, the
  White Sea, and the Scandinavian Peninsula, returns to Iceland. Though
  much skill and heroism have been displayed in the exploration of this
  portion of the earth, there is still an area round the pole estimated at
  2,500,000 sq. miles, which is a blank to geographers. Many have adopted
  the belief in the existence of an open polar sea about the north pole.
  But this belief is not supported by any positive evidence. Valuable
  minerals, fossils, &amp;c., have been discovered within the Arctic
  regions. In the archipelago north of the American continent excellent
  coal frequently occurs. The mineral cryolite is mined in Greenland.
  Fossil ivory is obtained in islands at the mouth of the Lena. In
  Scandinavia, parts of Siberia, and north-west America, the forest region
  extends within the Arctic Circle. The most characteristic of the natives
  of the Arctic regions are the Esquimaux. The most notable animals are the
  white-bear, the musk-ox, the reindeer, and the whalebone whale.
  Fur-bearing animals are numerous. The most intense cold ever registered
  in those regions was 74° below zero F. The aurora borealis is a brilliant
  phenomenon of Arctic nights. See <i>North Polar Expeditions</i>.</p>

  beasts. It was usually covered with sand or saw-dust to prevent the
  gladiators from slipping, and to absorb the blood. See
  <i>Amphitheatre</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Arenaceous Rocks</b> include all sediments in which quartz sand is
  the most important constituent. Owing to its resistance to comminution
  and to chemical attack, quartz accumulates in sea-beaches while other
  mineral matter becomes removed. Hence sands gather near a shore and
  ultimately become consolidated by various natural cements into
  sandstones, those cemented by silica being styled quartzites. Sand-dunes
  in deserts or on coasts are unconsolidated arenaceous rock-masses.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´endal</b> a seaport of Southern Norway, exporting timber, wood

  <p><b>Are´olar Tissue</b>, an assemblage of fibres in bundles, pervading
  almost every part of the animal structure, and connected with each other
  so as to form innumerable small cavities, the whole serving as a means by
  which the various organs and parts of organs are connected together. It
  is called also <i>Cellular Tissue</i> and <i>Connective Tissue</i>. The
  fibres are of two kinds&mdash;white fibrous tissue and yellow elastic
  fibrous tissue, and interspersed among the bundles or occupying the
  cellular cavities are cells and corpuscles of several kinds. It is a
  tissue found in large quantities under the skin, covering the muscles,
  the blood-vessels, and nerves, and in various parts forming a kind of
  protective covering for delicate and important organs. It is because of
  its general distribution, and because of its binding various structures
  together, that it is called <i>connective</i>.&mdash;In botany the term
  is sometimes applied to the <i>non</i>-vascular substance, composed
  entirely of untransformed cells, which forms the soft substance of
  plants. <!-- Page 229 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p><b>Areop´agus</b>, the oldest of the Athenian courts of justice, an
  assembly having a position more august than an ordinary court, and in its
  best days exercising a general supervision over public morals. It
  obtained its name from its place of meeting, on the Hill of Ares (Mars),
  near the Acropolis or citadel of Athens. Another explanation connects the
  word with <i>Aræ</i> (Curses), commonly known as <i>Semnæ</i> (Awful
  Goddesses), who were the guardians of the hill. It existed from very
  remote times, and the crimes tried before it were wilful murder,
  poisoning, robbery, and arson, while it had under its control also
  dissoluteness of morals, and innovations in the State and in religion.
  Its meetings were held in the open air, and its members were selected
  from those who had held the office of archon. The tribunal eventually
  lost many of its powers, but it continued to exist in name at least as
  late as the time of Cicero or later, having had an existence of seven or
  eight hundred years.</p>

  capital of a province of same name, situated in a fertile valley, 7850
  feet above sea-level, at a distance of about 55 miles from the coast and
  on the railway which runs from its port Mollendo inland to Puno on Lake
  Titicaca. Behind the city rises the volcano of Arequipa, or Peak of Misti
  (20,328 feet). The climate is healthy but the locality is liable to
  earthquakes, one of which almost completely destroyed the town in 1868,
  after which it was rapidly rebuilt. A considerable trade is carried on
  through Mollendo, there being a large transit trade with the interior,
  and the town carries on various industries, manufacturing cotton and
  woollen goods, &amp;c. It was founded in 1540. Pop. 35,000 to

  a nymph changed by Art&#x115;mis into a fountain in order to free her
  from the pursuit of the river-god Alpheus. This fountain was said to
  exist in the small Island of Ortygia, near Syracuse, and was fabled to
  have a subterranean connection with the River Alpheus in Greece.</p>

  <p><b>Aretino</b> (ä-r&#x101;-t&#x113;´nö), Guido. See <i>Guido</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Aretino</b>, Pietro, Italian poet, born at Arezzo 1492, died at
  Venice 1556, the natural son of a nobleman called Luigi Bacci. He early
  displayed a talent for satirical poetry, and when still a young man was
  banished from Arezzo on account of a sonnet against indulgences. He went
  to Perugia, and thence to Rome (1517), where he secured the papal
  patronage, but subsequently lost it through writing licentious sonnets.
  Through the influence of the Medici family he found an opportunity to
  insinuate himself into the favour of Francis I. In 1527 Aretino went to
  Venice, where he acquired powerful friends, among them the Bishop of
  Vicenza. By his devotional writings he regained the favour of the Roman
  Court. He called himself 'the divine', and 'the scourge of princes', but
  he was also their abject flatterer, and that solely to obtain money. The
  obscenity of some of his writings was such that his name has become
  proverbial for licentiousness. Among them are five comedies and a
  tragedy.</p>

  <p><b>Arezzo</b> (a<span class="x1"><span

  a city of Central Italy, capital of a province of the same name in
  Tuscany, near the confluence of the Chiana with the Arno. It has a noble
  cathedral, containing some fine pictures and monuments; remains of an
  ancient amphitheatre, &amp;c. It was one of the twelve chief Etruscan
  towns, and in later times fought long against the Florentines, to whom it
  had finally to succumb. It is the birthplace of Mæcenas, Petrarch, Pietro
  Aretino, Redi, and Vasari. Pop. 50,093.&mdash;The province of Arezzo

  <p><b>Ar´gentine Republic</b>, formerly called the United Provinces of
  <b>La Plata</b>, a vast country of South America, the extreme length of
  which is 2300 miles, and the average breadth a little over 500 miles, the
  total area 1,153,119 sq. miles. It consists of fourteen provinces, ten
  territories, and one federal district. It is bounded on the <span
  class="scac">N.</span> by Bolivia; on the <span class="scac">E.</span> by
  Paraguay, Brazil, Uruguay, and the Atlantic; on the <span
  class="scac">S.</span> by the Antarctic Ocean; and on the <span
  class="scac">W.</span> by the Andes. It comprises four great natural
  divisions: (1) the Andine region, containing the provinces of Mendoza,
  San Juan, Rioja, Catamarca, Tucuman, Salta, and Jujuy; (2) the Pampas,
  containing the provinces of Santiago, Santa Fé, Cordova, San Luis, and
  Buenos Ayres, with the territories Formosa, Pampa, and Chaco; (3) the
  Argentine 'mesopotamia', between the Rivers Paraná and Uruguay,
  containing the provinces of Entre Rios and Corrientes, and the territory
  Misiones; (4) Patagonia, including the eastern half of Tierra del Fuego.
  With the exception of the <span class="scac">N.W.</span>, where lateral
  branches of the Andes run into the <!-- Page 231 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page231"></a>[231]</span>plain for 150 or 200
  miles, and the province of Entre Rios, which is hilly, the characteristic
  feature of the country is the great monotonous and level plains called
  'pampas'. In the north these plains are partly forest-covered, but all
  the central and southern parts present vast treeless tracts, which afford
  pasture to immense herds of horses, oxen, and sheep, and are varied in
  some places by brackish swamps, in others by salt steppes. The great
  water-course of the country is the Paraná, having a length of fully 2000
  miles from its source in the mountains of Goyaz, Brazil, to its junction
  with the Uruguay, where begins the estuary of La Plata. The Paraná is
  formed by the union of the Upper Paraná and Paraguay Rivers, near the
  <span class="scac">N.E.</span> corner of the State. Important tributaries
  are the Pilcomayo, the Vermejo, and the Salado. The Paraná, Paraguay, and
  Uruguay are valuable for internal navigation. Many of the streams which
  tend eastward terminate in marshes and salt lakes, some of which are
  rather extensive. Not connected with the La Plata system are the Colorado
  and the Rio Negro, the latter formerly the southern boundary of the
  State, separating it from Patagonia. The source of the Negro is Lake
  Nahuel Huapi, in Patagonia (area, 1200 sq. miles), in the midst of
  magnificent scenery. The level portions of the country are mostly of
  tertiary formation, and the river and coast regions consist mainly of
  alluvial soil of great fertility. In the pampas clay have been found the
  fossil remains of extinct mammalia, some of them of colossal size.</p>

  <p>European grains and fruits, including the vine, have been successfully
  introduced, and large areas are now under wheat, maize, flax, and other
  crops, another source of wealth consisting in the countless herds of
  cattle and horses and flocks of sheep, which are pastured on the pampas,
  and which multiply there very rapidly. Gold, silver, nickel, copper, tin,
  lead, and iron, besides marble, jasper, precious stones, and bitumen, are
  found in the mountainous districts of the <span class="scac">N.W.</span>,
  while petroleum wells have been discovered on the Rio Vermejo; but the
  development of this mineral wealth has hitherto been greatly retarded by
  the want of proper means of transport. As a whole there are not extensive
  forests in the State except in the region of the Gran Chaco (which
  extends also into Bolivia), where there is known to be 60,000 sq. miles
  of timber. Thousands of square miles are covered with thistles, which
  grow to a great height in their season. Cacti also forms great thickets.
  Peach and apple trees are abundant in some districts. The native fauna
  includes the puma, the jaguar, the tapir, the llama, the alpaca, the
  vicuña, armadillos, the rhea or nandu, a species of ostrich, &amp;c. The
  climate is agreeable and healthy, 97° being about the highest temperature
  experienced. The rainfall is very scanty in some districts, and is
  nowhere very large.</p>

  <p>As a whole this vast country is very thinly inhabited, some parts of
  it as yet being very little known. The native Indians were never very
  numerous, and have given little trouble to the European settlers. Tribes
  of them yet in the savage state still inhabit the less-known districts,
  and live by hunting and fishing. Some of the Gran Chaco tribes are said
  to be very fierce, and European travellers have been killed by them. The
  European element is strong in the republic, more than half the population
  being Europeans or of pure European descent. Large numbers of immigrants
  arrive from Southern Europe, the Italians having the preponderance among
  those of foreign birth. The typical inhabitants of the pampas are the
  <i>Gauchos</i>, a race of half-breed cattle-rearers and horse-breakers;
  they are almost continually on horseback, galloping over the plains,
  collecting their herds and droves, taming wild horses, or catching and
  slaughtering cattle. In such occupations they require a marvellous
  dexterity in the use of the lasso and bolas.</p>

  <p>The River La Plata was discovered in 1512 by the Spanish navigator
  Juan Diaz de Solis, and the La Plata territory had been brought into the
  possession of Spain by the end of the sixteenth century. In 1810 the
  territory cast off the Spanish rule, and in 1816 the independence of the
  United States of the Rio de la Plata was formerly declared, but it was
  long before a settled government was established. The present
  constitution dates from 1853, being modified in 1866 and 1898. The
  executive power is vested in a president&mdash;elected by the
  representatives of the fourteen provinces for a term of six years. A
  national congress of two chambers&mdash;a Senate and a House of
  Deputies&mdash;wields the legislative authority, and the republic is
  making rapid advances in social and political life. The national revenue
  for 1918 amounted to about £32,860,306, while the expenditure amounted to
  £34,407,074; the public debt was, at the end of 1916, about £120,000,000.
  There are about 22,000 miles of railway opened. The external commerce is
  important, the chief exports being beef and mutton, wheat, maize, and
  linseed, wool, skins and hides, tallow. The imports are chiefly
  manufactured goods. The trade is largely with Britain and France, and is
  increasing rapidly, the exports having advanced from £9,000,000 in 1876
  and £73,200,000 in 1908 to £201,360,000 in 1920. The imports in 1920 were
  £170,820,000. The chief denomination of money is the dollar or
  <i>peso</i>, value (in gold) 4<i>s.</i> Buenos Ayres (or Aires) is the
  capital. Other towns are Rosario, Cordova, La Plata, Tucuman, Mendoza,
  and <!-- Page 232 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page232"></a>[232]</span>Santa-Fé. The population of the republic,
  which is rapidly increasing by immigration, was, in 1905, 5,678,197, and
  8,284,266 in 1918; of the capital, 1,637,155 (1918).&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Argon</b>, a gas which is fairly widely distributed in the free
  state and is a constant constituent of the atmosphere, of which it forms
  about 1 per cent by volume. It was discovered by Lord Rayleigh and
  Professor Ramsay in 1894. During their determinations of the density of
  nitrogen they noticed that the density of nitrogen derived from the air
  differed from the density of nitrogen derived from ammonia and other
  compounds of nitrogen, and after a series of very careful experiments
  they succeeded in isolating a new gas, which they named Argon. The gas
  occurs in sea and river water, in plants, in the blood of animals, and
  the gases issuing from volcanoes and mineral springs. It is always in the
  free state and never in combination, and is associated with nitrogen. It
  is colourless, odourless, and tasteless, and may be liquefied and
  solidified. It is heavier than air, and is chemically a very inert
  substance. It is usually referred to as one of the <i>rare</i> gases of
  the atmosphere. Argon is manufactured in fairly large quantity from air,
  making use of the inertness of the substance compared to oxygen and
  nitrogen, the chief constituents of the air. Several methods are in use,
  e.g. nitrogen may be removed by passing it repeatedly over red-hot
  magnesium; thus the nitrogen is absorbed and the argon left. When oxygen
  and nitrogen of air are absorbed by a mixture of 90 per cent calcium
  carbide and 10 per cent calcium chloride previously heated to redness
  <i>in vacuo</i>, a gas becoming richer and richer in argon is obtained.
  Another method of preparing argon is by fractionation of liquid air. It
  is used for filling electric bulbs.</p>

    Argonaut&mdash;Female
  </div>

  <p><b>Ar´gonaut</b>, a molluscous animal of the genus Argonauta,
  belonging to the dibranchiate or two-gilled cuttle-fishes, distinguished
  by the females possessing a single-chambered external shell, not
  organically connected with the body of the animal. The males have no
  shell and are of much smaller size than the females. The shell is
  fragile, translucent, and boat-like in shape; it serves as the receptacle
  of the ova or eggs of the female, which sits in it with the respiratory
  tube or 'funnel' turned towards the carina or 'keel'. This famed mollusc
  swims only by ejecting water from its funnel, and it can crawl in a
  reversed position, carrying its shell over its back like a snail. The
  account of its floating on the surface of the sea, with its sail-shaped
  arms extended to catch the breeze, and with the six other arms as oars,
  is a mere fable. The argonaut, or <i>paper-nautilus</i>, must be
  carefully distinguished from the <i>pearly-nautilus</i> or nautilus
  proper (<i>Nautilus Pompilius</i>).</p>

  <p><b>Argonauts</b>, in the legendary history of Greece, those heroes who
  performed a hazardous voyage to Colchis, a far-distant country at the
  eastern extremity of the Euxine (Black Sea), with Jason in the ship
  <i>Argo</i>, for the purpose of securing a golden fleece, which was
  preserved suspended upon a tree, and under the guardianship of a
  sleepless dragon. By the aid of Medea, daughter of the King of Colchis,
  Jason was enabled to seize the fleece, and, after many strange
  adventures, to reach his home at Iolcos in Thessaly. Among the Argonauts
  were Hercules, Castor and Pollux, Orpheus and Theseus.&mdash;<span

  situated the remarkable star Eta Argûs. It is variable, generally faint,
  but in 1837 it became temporarily one of the brightest stars in the
  sky.</p>

  <p><b>Argonne</b>, a district of France, between the Rivers Meuse, Marne,
  and Aisne, celebrated for the campaign of Dumouriez against the Prussians
  in 1792, and for the military movements and actions which took place
  therein previous to the battle of Sedan, in 1870.</p>

  <p><b>Argonne, Battle of.</b> When, in the autumn of 1914, the Allies
  retreated towards the Marne, the German Crown Prince's army endeavoured
  to invest Verdun. His right wing advanced through the thick and extensive
  forest of Argonne, but took precipitate flight after the battle of the
  Marne before the army of General Sarrail. In the summer of 1915 the Crown
  Prince endeavoured to hack his way through the French Argonne lines,
  using much heavy artillery, poison-gas, liquid-fire, and tear-shells. A
  final effort to break through was made in September, between Le Four de
  Paris and Vienne-le-Château, but, after gaining a footing in the first
  line of French trenches, the Germans were hurled back by a dashing
  counter-attack. The great salient from the Argonne to St. Mihiel was the
  salvation of Verdun.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´gos</b>, a town of Greece, in the north-east of the
  Peloponnesus, between the Gulfs of Ægina and Nauplia or Argos. This town
  and the surrounding territory of Argolis were famous from the legendary
  period of Greek history onwards. Here, besides Argos, was Mycenæ, where
  Agamemnon ruled. Modern Argos is a straggling place of 10,000
  inhabitants, with some ancient remains. The territory Argolis forms a
  nomarchy of Greece. Pop., Argolis and Corinthia, 153,172. The capital is
  Nauplia.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´gosy</b>, a poetical name for a large merchant-vessel; derived
  from <i>Ragusa</i>, a port which was formerly more celebrated than now,
  and whose vessels did a considerable trade with England. It is popularly
  but erroneously connected with the ship <i>Argo</i> in which Jason
  sailed. See <i>Argonauts</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Argot</b> (Fr.; a<span class="x1"><span

  Its possession was violently disputed between the Portuguese, Dutch,
  English, and French.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´gument</b>, a term sometimes used as synonymous with the
  <i>subject</i> of a discourse, but more frequently appropriated to any
  kind of method employed for the purpose of confuting or at least
  silencing an opponent. Logicians have reduced arguments to a number of
  distinct heads, such as the <i>argumentum ad judicium</i>, which founds
  on solid proofs and addresses to the judgment; the <i>argumentum ad
  verecundiam</i>, which appeals to the modesty or bashfulness of an
  opponent by reminding him of the great names or authorities by whom the
  view disputed by him is supported; the <i>argumentum ad ignorantiam</i>,
  the employment of some logical fallacy towards persons likely to be
  deceived by it; and the <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>, an argument which
  presses a man with consequences drawn from his own principles and
  concessions, or his own conduct. See <i>Fallacy</i>, <i>Logic</i>.</p>

  pheasant, found native in the south-east of Asia, more especially in
  Sumatra and some of the other islands. The males measure from 5 to 6 feet
  from the tip of the beak to the extremity of the tail, which has two
  greatly-elongated central feathers. The plumage is exceedingly beautiful,
  the secondary quills of the wings, which are longer than the primary
  feathers, being each adorned with a series of ocellated or eye-like spots
  (whence the name&mdash;see <i>Argus</i>) of brilliant metallic hues. The

  <p><b>Argyll</b>, or <b>Argyle</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>r-g&#x12B;l´), an extensive county in the
  south-west of the Highlands of Scotland, consisting partly of mainland
  and partly of islands belonging to the Hebrides group, the chief of which
  are Islay, Mull, Jura, Tiree, Coll, Luing, Lismore, and Colonsay, with
  Iona and Staffa. On the land side the mainland is bounded north by
  Inverness; east by Perth and Dumbarton; elsewhere surrounded by the Firth
  of Clyde and its connections and the sea; area, 3255 sq. miles (or over
  2,000,000 acres), of which the islands comprise about 1000 sq. miles. It
  is greatly indented by arms of the sea, which penetrate far inland, the
  most important of these being Loch Sunart, Loch Linnhe (the extremities
  of which are Loch Eil and Loch Leven), Loch Etive, Loch Fyne, Loch
  Tarbert, Loch Riddon, Loch Striven, and Loch Long. The mainland is
  divided into six districts of Northern Argyle, Lorn, Argyle, Cowal,
  Knapdale, and Kintyre; the two first being subdivided into the
  sub-districts of Lochiel, Ardgour, Sunart, Ardnamurchan, Morven, and
  Appin. The county is exceedingly mountainous, the chief summits being
  Bidean-nam-Bian (3766 feet), Ben Laoigh (3708 feet), Ben Cruachan (3611
  feet), Benmore, in Mull (3185 feet), the Paps of Jura (2565 feet), and
  Ben Arthur or the Cobbler (2891 feet). There are several lakes, the
  principal of which is Loch Awe. Cattle and sheep are reared in numbers,
  and fishing is largely carried on, as is also the making of whisky. There
  is but little arable land. The chief minerals are slate, marble,
  limestone, and granite. County town, Inveraray; others, Campbeltown,
  Oban, and Dunoon. Pop. (1921), 76,856.</p>

  <p><b>Argyll, Campbells of</b>, a historic Scottish family, raised to the
  peerage in the person of Sir Duncan Campbell of Lochow, in 1445. The more
  eminent members are: Archibald, 2nd Earl, killed at the battle of
  Flodden, 1513.&mdash;Archibald, 5th Earl, attached himself to the party
  of Mary of Guise, and was the means of averting a collision between the
  Reformers and the French troops in 1559; was commissioner of regency
  after Mary's abdication, but afterwards commanded her troops at the
  battle of Langside; died 1575.&mdash;Archibald, 8th Earl and 1st
  Marquess, born 1598: a zealous partisan of the Covenanters; created a
  marquess by Charles I. It was by his persuasion that Charles II visited
  Scotland, and was crowned at Scone in 1651. At the Restoration he was
  committed to the Tower, and afterwards sent to Scotland, where he was
  tried for high treason, and beheaded in 1661.&mdash;Archibald, 9th Earl,
  son of the preceding, served the king with great bravery at the battle of
  Dunbar, and was excluded from the general pardon by Cromwell in 1654. On
  the passing of the Test Act in 1681 he refused to take the required oath
  except with a reservation. For this he was tried and sentenced to death.
  He managed to escape to Holland, from whence he returned with a view of
  aiding the Duke of Monmouth. His plan, however, failed, and he was taken
  and conveyed to Edinburgh, where he was beheaded in
  1685.&mdash;Archibald, 10th Earl and 1st Duke, son of the preceding, died
  1703; took an active part in the Revolution of 1688-9, which placed
  William and Mary on the throne, and was rewarded by several important
  appointments and the title of duke.&mdash;John, 2nd Duke and Duke of
  Greenwich, son of the above, born 1678, died 1743; served under
  Marlborough at the battles of Ramillies, Oudenarde, and Malplaquet, and
  assisted at the sieges of Lisle and Ghent. He incurred considerable odium
  in his own country for his efforts in promoting the union. In 1712 he had
  the military command in Scotland, and in 1715 he fought an indecisive
  battle with the Earl of Mar's army at Sheriffmuir, near Dunblane, and
  forced the Pretender to quit the kingdom. He was long a supporter of

  <p><b>Ar´ians</b>, the adherents of the Alexandrian presbyter Arius, who,
  about <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 318, promulgated the doctrine that
  Christ was a created being inferior to God the Father in nature and
  dignity, though the first and noblest of all created beings; and also
  that the Holy Spirit is not God, but created by the power of the Son.
  Arianism has been defined as an attempt to determine the relations of the
  Persons of the Trinity on a basis of distinction and subordination. It
  does not seem to have sprung from any strong ethical impulse; its
  philosophy was pagan, and the object of the leaders political rather than
  religious. The doctrines were condemned by the Council of Nicæa in 325.
  Arius died in 336, and after his death his party gained considerable
  accessions, including several emperors, and for a time held a strong
  position. Since the middle of the seventh century, however, the Arians
  have nowhere constituted a distinct sect, although similar opinions have
  been advanced by various theologians in modern times. The Arian
  controversy was revived in England during the eighteenth century by
  William Whiston and Dr. Samuel Clarke.&mdash;<span

  Italy. Returning from Tarentum to Corinth with rich treasures, the
  avaricious sailors resolved to murder him. Apollo, however, having
  informed him in a dream of the impending danger, Arion in vain
  endeavoured to soften the hearts of the crew by the power of music. He
  then threw himself into the sea, when one of a shoal of dolphins, which
  had been attracted by his music, received him on his back and bore him to
  land. The sailors, having returned to Corinth, were confronted by Arion
  and convicted of their crime. The lyre of Arion, and the dolphin which
  rescued him, became constellations in the heavens. A fragment of a hymn

  <p><b>Arios´to, Ludovi´co</b>, one of the most celebrated poets of Italy,
  was born at Reggio, in Lombardy, 8th Sept., 1474, of a noble family; died
  6th June, 1533. His lyric poems in the Italian and Latin languages,
  distinguished for ease and elegance of style, introduced him to the
  notice of the Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, son of Duke Ercole I of Ferrara.
  In 1503 Ippolito employed him in his service and used his counsel in the
  most important affairs. In this service he began and finished, in ten or
  eleven years, his immortal poem, the <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, which was
  published in 1515, and immediately became highly popular. He afterwards
  entered the service of Alfonso I, Duke of Ferrara, the cardinal's
  brother, a lover of the arts, who put much confidence in him. After
  quelling disturbances that had broken out in the wild and mountainous
  Garfagnana, he returned to Ferrara, where he employed himself in the
  composition of his comedies, and in putting the last touches to his
  <i>Orlando</i>. The <i>Orlando Furioso</i> is a continuation of the
  <i>Orlando Innamorato</i> of Bojardo, details the chivalrous adventures
  of the paladins of the age of Charlemagne, and extends to forty-six
  cantos. The best English translation is that of Rose (1823). Cf. E.

  <p><b>Aristides</b> (a-ris-t&#x12B;´d&#x113;z), a statesman of ancient
  Greece, for his strict integrity surnamed the <i>Just</i>. He was one of
  the ten generals of the Athenians when they fought with the Persians at
  Marathon, 490 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> Next year he was eponymous
  archon, and in this office enjoyed such popularity that he excited the
  jealousy of Themistocles, who succeeded in procuring his banishment by
  ostracism (about 483). Three years after, when Xerxes invaded Greece with
  a large army, the Athenians hastened to recall him, and Themistocles now
  admitted him to his confidence and councils. In the battle of Platæa
  (479) he commanded the Athenians, and had a great share in gaining the
  victory. To defray the expenses of the Persian war he persuaded the
  Greeks to impose a tax, which should be paid into the hands of an officer
  appointed by the States collectively, and deposited at Delos. The
  confidence which was felt in his integrity appeared in their entrusting
  him with the office of apportioning the contribution. He died at an
  advanced age about 468 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, so poor that he
  was buried at the public expense.</p>

  <p><b>Aristip´pus</b> (c. 425-366 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), a

  Cyr&#x113;n&#x113;, in Africa; flourished 380 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> His moral philosophy differed widely from that
  of Socrates, and was a science of refined voluptuousness. His fundamental
  principles were&mdash;that all human sensations may be reduced to two,
  pleasure and pain. Pleasure is a gentle, and pain a violent emotion. All
  living beings seek the former and avoid the latter. Happiness is nothing
  but a continued pleasure, composed of separate gratifications; and as it
  is the object of all human exertions, we should abstain from no kind of
  pleasure. Still we should always be governed by taste and reason in our
  enjoyments. His doctrines were taught only by his daughter
  Ar&#x115;t&#x113;, and by his grandson Aristippus the younger, by whom
  they were <!-- Page 237 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  them into a particular doctrine of pleasure, and are hence called

  is known of his life. He appeared as a poet in 427 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, and having indulged in some sarcasms on the
  powerful demagogue Cleon, was ineffectually accused by the latter of
  having unlawfully assumed the title of an Athenian citizen. He afterwards
  revenged himself on Cleon in his comedy of the <i>Knights</i>, in which
  he himself acted the part of Cleon, because no actor had the courage to
  do it. Of fifty-four (or forty-four) comedies attributed to him, eleven
  only remain; believed to be the flower of the ancient comedy, and
  distinguished by wit, humour, and poetry, as also by grossness. In them
  there is constant reference to the manners, actions, and public
  characters of the day, the freedom of the old Greek comedy allowing an
  unbounded degree of personal and political satire. The names of his
  extant plays are <i>Acharnians</i>, <i>Knights</i>, <i>Clouds</i>,

  <p><b>Ar´istotle</b> (Gr. <i>Aristot´eles</i>), a distinguished
  philosopher and naturalist of ancient Greece, the founder of the
  Peripatetic school of philosophy, was born in 384 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> at Stagira, in Macedonia; died at Chalcis, 322
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span> His father, Nicomachus, was physician to
  Amyntas II, King of Macedonia, and claimed to be descended from
  Æsculapius. Aristotle had lost his parents before he came, at about the
  age of seventeen, to Athens to study in the school of Plato. With that
  philosopher he remained for twenty years, became pre-eminent among his
  pupils, and was known as the 'Intellect of the School'. Upon the death of
  Plato, 348 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, he took up his residence at
  Atarneus, in Mysia, on the invitation of his former pupil Hermeias, the
  ruler of that city, on whose assassination by the Persians, 343 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, he fled to Mitylene with his wife Pythias, a
  near relative of Hermeias. During his residence at Mitylene he received
  an invitation from Philip of Macedon to superintend the education of his
  son Alexander, then in his fourteenth year. This relationship between the
  great philosopher and the future conqueror continued for five or six
  years, during which the prince was instructed in grammar, rhetoric,
  poetry, logic, ethics, and politics, and in those branches of physics
  which had even then made some considerable progress. On Alexander
  succeeding to the throne Aristotle continued to live with him as his
  friend and councillor till he set out on his Asiatic campaign (334 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>). He returned to Athens and established his
  school in the Lyceum, a gymnasium attached to the temple of Apollo
  Lyceius, which was assigned to him by the State. He delivered his
  lectures in the wooded walks of the Lyceum while walking up and down with
  his pupils. From the action itself, or more probably from the name of the
  walks (<i>peripatoi</i>), his school was called Peripatetic. Pupils
  gathered to him from all parts of Greece, and his school became by far
  the most popular in Athens. The statement that he had two circles of
  pupils, the <i>exoteric</i> and the <i>esoteric</i> has given rise to
  much controversy. By some it has been held that Aristotle published
  during his lifetime popular discourses with a view to make way for his
  doctrines in Athenian society, then impregnated with Platonic theories,
  and that these are called exoteric in contradistinction to those in which
  are embodied his matured opinions. It was during the time of his teaching
  at Athens that Aristotle is believed to have composed the great bulk of
  his works. But it is not possible to speak with any certainty about the
  chronology of his writings, as the references may be additions of
  editors. On the death of Alexander a revolution occurred in Athens
  hostile to the Macedonian interests with which Aristotle was identified.
  He therefore retired to Chalcis, where he soon after died. Sir <!-- Page
  238 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page238"></a>[238]</span>Charles
  Walston, in 1891, opened a tomb near Eretria which he supposed to be that
  of Aristotle. According to Strabo he bequeathed all his works to
  Theophrastus, who, with other disciples of Aristotle, amended and
  continued them. They afterwards passed through various hands, till, about
  50 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, Andronicus of Rhodes put the various
  fragments together and classified them according to a systematic
  arrangement. Many of the books bearing his name are spurious, others are
  of doubtful genuineness. The whole are generally divided into logical,
  theoretical, and practical. The logical works are comprehended under the
  title <i>Organon</i> (Instrument). The theoretical are divided into
  physics, mathematics, and metaphysics. The physical works (including
  those on natural history) are on the <i>General Principles of Physical
  Science</i>, <i>The Heavens</i>, <i>Generation and Destruction</i>,
  <i>Meteorology</i>, <i>Natural History of Animals</i>, <i>On the Parts of
  Animals</i>, <i>On the Generation of Animals</i>, <i>On the Locomotion of
  Animals</i>, <i>On the Soul</i>, <i>On Memory</i>, <i>Sleep and
  Waking</i>, <i>Dreams</i>, <i>Divination</i>. In mathematics there are
  two treatises, <i>On Indivisible Lines</i> and <i>Mechanical
  Problems</i>. <i>The Metaphysics</i> consist of fourteen books; the title
  (<i>Ta meta ta Physika</i>, 'the things following the Physics',) is the
  invention of an editor. The practical works embrace ethics, politics,
  economics, and treatises on art, and comprise the <i>Nicomachæan
  Ethics</i> (so called because dedicated to his son, Nicomachus), <i>The
  Politics</i>, <i>&OElig;conomics</i>, <i>Poetry</i>, and <i>Rhetoric</i>.
  Among the lost works are the dialogues and others termed exoteric. A
  treatise <i>On the Constitution of Athens</i> was discovered in 1891. His
  style is devoid of grace and elegance. His works were first printed in a
  Latin translation, with the commentaries of Averroes, at Venice in 1489;
  the first Greek edition was that of Aldus Manutius (5 vols., 1495-8). See

  <p><b>Aristox´enus,</b> an ancient Greek musician and philosopher of
  Tarentum, born about 324 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> He studied music
  under his father Mnesias, and philosophy under Aristotle, whose successor
  he aspired to be. He endeavoured to apply his musical knowledge to
  philosophy, and especially to the science of mind, but it only appears to
  have furnished him with far-fetched analogies and led him into a kind of
  materialism. We have a work on the <i>Elements of Harmony</i> by him.</p>

  <p><b>Arith´metic</b> (Gr. <i>arithmos</i>, number) is primarily the
  science of numbers. As opposed to algebra it is the practical part of the
  science. Although the processes of arithmetical operations are often
  highly complicated, they all resolve themselves into the repetition of
  four primary operations&mdash;addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
  division. Of these the two latter are only complex forms of the two
  former, and subtraction again is merely a reversal of the process of
  addition. Little or nothing is known as to the origin and invention of
  arithmetic. Some elementary conception of it is in all probability coeval
  with the first dawn of human intelligence. In consequence of their rude
  methods of numeration, the science made but small advance among the
  ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, and it was not until the
  introduction of the decimal scale of notation and the Arabic, or rather
  Indian, numerals into Europe that any great progress can be traced. In
  this scale of notation every number is expressed by means of the ten
  digits, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, by giving each digit a local as
  well as its proper or natural value. The value of every digit increases
  in a tenfold proportion from the right towards the left; the distance of
  any figure from the right indicating the power of 10, and the digit
  itself the number of those powers intended to be expressed: thus 3464 =
  3000 + 400 + 60 + 4 = 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> + 4 × 10<sup>2</sup> + 6 × 10 +
  4. The earliest arithmetical signs appear to have been hieroglyphical,
  but the Egyptian hieroglyphics were too diffuse to be of any arithmetical
  value. The units were successive strokes to the number required, the ten
  an open circle, the hundred a curled palm-leaf, the thousand a lotus
  flower, ten thousand a bent finger. The letters of the alphabet afforded
  a convenient mode of representing figures, and were used accordingly by
  the Chaldeans, Hebrews, and Greeks. The first nine letters of the Hebrew
  alphabet represented the units, the second nine tens, the remaining four
  together with five repeated with additional marks, hundreds; the same
  succession of letters with added points was repeated for thousands, tens
  of thousands, and hundreds of thousands. The Greeks followed the same
  system up to tens of thousands. They wrote the different classes of
  numbers in succession as we do, and they transferred operations performed
  on units to numbers in higher places; but the use of different signs for
  the different ranks clearly shows a want of full perception of the value
  of place as such. They adopted the letter M as a sign for 10,000 and by
  combining this mark with their other numerals they could note numbers as
  high as 100,000,000. The Roman numerals, which are still used in marking
  dates or numbering chapters, were almost useless for purposes of
  computation. From one to four were represented by vertical strokes <a

  <i>abstract</i> and <i>practical</i>: the former comprehends notation,
  numeration, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, measures and
  multiples, fractions, powers and roots; the latter treats of the
  combinations and practical applications of these and the so-called rules,
  such as reduction, compound addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
  division, proportion, interest, profit and loss, &amp;c. Another division
  is <i>integral</i> and <i>fractional</i> arithmetic, the former treating
  of integers, or whole numbers, and the latter of fractions. Decimal
  fractions were invented in the sixteenth century, and logarithms,
  embodying the last great advance in the science, in the seventeenth
  century.</p>

  <p><b>Arizo´na</b>, a former territory of the United States, admitted
  into the union as a sovereign State on 14th Feb., 1912, is bounded south
  by Mexico, west by California and Nevada (the River Colorado forming the
  greater part of the boundary), north by Utah, and east by New Mexico;
  area, 113,956 sq. miles. The surface is generally mountainous, but many
  fertile and well-watered valleys lie between the ridges. Part of the
  surface consists of deserts often entirely destitute of vegetation. The
  territory belongs to the basin of the Colorado, which passes through a
  portion of it, besides forming the boundary; while the Gila and Little
  Colorado, tributaries of the Colorado, traverse it from east to west. The
  canyons of the Colorado form a wonderful feature, the river flowing for
  hundreds of miles in a deep rocky channel with walls rising
  perpendicularly to the height of 1500 to 6000 feet. In some parts timber
  is plentiful. The rainfall is small, and irrigation has been employed for
  agricultural purposes. Large tracts of elevated land have been found
  excellently adapted as pastures for sheep and cattle. The territory is
  rich in copper, gold, silver, lead, and other minerals, and mining is
  largely carried on, with much copper smelting and refining. The capital
  is Ph&oelig;nix. Pop. 29,053. The Southern and the Santa Fé Pacific
  Railways traverse it. Pop. (1920), 333,903 (of which 171,468 are white),

  of America, bounded north by Missouri; east by the Mississippi, which
  separates it from the States of Mississippi and Tennessee; south by
  Louisiana and Texas; and west by the Indian Territory and Texas; area,
  53,335 sq. miles. The surface in the east is low, flat, and swampy,
  densely wooded, and subject to frequent inundations from the numerous
  streams which water it. Towards the centre it becomes more diversified,
  presenting many undulating slopes and hills of moderate elevation. In the
  west it <!-- Page 240 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page240"></a>[240]</span>rises still higher, being traversed by a
  range of hills called the Ozark, which attains a height of 2000 feet,
  some peaks rising to 3000. In various parts the prairies are of great
  extent; the forests also are extensive, principally of oak, hickory, ash,
  cotton, linden, maple, locust, and pine. Coal and other minerals are
  worked. The principal rivers, all tributaries of the Mississippi, are the
  Arkansas, the Red River, the St. Francis, and the Washita. Near the
  centre of the State are warm springs, much resorted to for chronic
  rheumatic and paralytic affections. The climate is subject to great
  extremes of heat and cold, and in the lower districts is unhealthy to new
  settlers. The staple products are cotton and maize; fruit is tolerably
  abundant. Many districts are admirably adapted for grazing, and great
  numbers of excellent cattle are reared. Arkansas was colonized as early
  as 1685 by the French. As part of Louisiana it was purchased by the
  United States in 1803. It was made into a separate territory in 1819, and
  admitted into the Union in 1836. It was one of the seceding States. The
  capital is Little Rock. The enumerated population in 1920 was
  1,750,995.</p>

    Arkwright's Water Frame
  </div>

  <p><b>Ark´wright</b>, Sir Richard, famous for his inventions in
  cotton-spinning, was born at Preston, in Lancashire, in 1732, died 1792.
  The youngest of thirteen children, he was bred to the trade of a barber.
  When about thirty-five years of age he gave himself up exclusively to the
  subject of inventions for spinning cotton. The thread spun by Hargreaves'
  jenny could not be used except as weft, being destitute of the firmness
  or hardness required in the longitudinal threads or warp. But Arkwright
  supplied this deficiency by the invention of the <i>spinning-frame</i>,
  which spins a vast number of threads of any degree of fineness and
  hardness, leaving the operator merely to feed the machine with cotton and
  to join the threads when they happen to break. His invention introduced
  the system of spinning by rollers, the carding, or <i>roving</i> as it is
  technically termed (that is, the soft, loose strip of cotton), passing
  through one pair of rollers, and being received by a second pair, which
  is made to revolve with (as the case may be) three, four, or five times
  the velocity of the first pair. By this contrivance the roving is drawn
  out into a thread of the desired degree of tenuity and hardness. His
  inventions being brought into a pretty advanced state, Arkwright removed
  to Nottingham in 1768 in order to avoid the attacks of the same lawless
  rabble that had driven Hargreaves out of Lancashire. Here his operations
  were at first greatly fettered by a want of capital; but two gentlemen of
  means having entered into partnership with him, the necessary funds were
  obtained, and Arkwright erected his first mill, which was driven by
  horses, at Nottingham, and took out a patent for spinning by rollers in
  1769. As the mode of working the machinery by horse-power was found too
  expensive, he built a second factory on a much larger scale at Cromford,
  in Derbyshire, in 1771, the machinery of which was turned by a
  water-wheel. Having made several additional discoveries and improvements
  in the processes of carding, roving, and spinning, he took out a fresh
  patent for the whole in 1775, and thus completed a series of the most
  ingenious and complicated machinery. Notwithstanding a series of
  law-suits in defence of his patent rights, and the destruction of his
  property by mobs, he amassed a large fortune. He was knighted by George
  III in 1786.</p>

  <p><b>Arm</b>, the upper limb in man, connected with the thorax or chest
  by means of the scapula or shoulder-blade, and the clavicle or
  collar-bone. It consists of three bones, the arm-bone
  (<i>hum&#x115;rus</i>), and the two bones of the fore-arm (<i>radius</i>
  and <i>ulna</i>), and it is connected with the bones of the hand by the
  <i>carpus</i> or wrist. The head or upper end of the arm-bone fits into
  the hollow called the <i>glenoid cavity</i> of the scapula, so as to form
  a joint of the ball-and-socket kind, allowing great freedom of movement
  to the limb. The lower end of the humerus is broadened out by a
  projection on both the outer and inner sides (the outer and inner
  <i>condyles</i>), and has a pulley-like surface for articulating with the
  fore-arm to form the elbow-joint. This joint somewhat resembles a hinge,
  allowing of movement only in one direction. The ulna is the inner of the
  two bones of the fore-arm. It is largest at the upper end, where it has
  two processes, the <i>coronoid</i> and the <i>olecranon</i>, with a deep
  groove between to receive the humerus. The radius&mdash;the outer of the
  two bones&mdash;is small at the upper and expanded at the lower end,
  where it forms part of the wrist-joint. The muscles of the upper arm are
  either <i>flexors</i> or <i>extensors</i>, the former serving to bend the
  arm, the latter to straighten it by means of the elbow-joint. The main
  flexor is the <i>biceps</i>, the large muscle which may be seen standing
  out in front of the arm when a weight is raised. The chief opposing
  muscle of the biceps is the <i>triceps</i>. The muscles of the fore-arm
  are, besides flexors and extensors, <i>pronators</i> and
  <i>supinators</i>, the former turning the hand palm downwards, the latter
  turning it upwards. The same fundamental plan of structure exists in the
  limbs of all vertebrate animals.</p>

  <p><b>Arma´da</b>, the Spanish name for any large naval force; usually
  applied to the Spanish fleet vaingloriously designated the <i>Invincible
  Armada</i>, intended to act against England <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1588. It was under the command of the Duke of
  Medina-Sidonia, and consisted of 130 great war vessels, larger and
  stronger than any belonging to the English fleet, with 30 smaller ships
  of war, and carried 19,295 marines, 8460 sailors, 2088 slaves, and 2630
  cannon. It had scarcely quitted Lisbon on 29th May, 1588, when it was
  scattered by a storm, and had to be refitted in Corunna. It was to
  co-operate with a land force collected in Flanders under the Prince of
  Parma, and to unite with this it proceeded through the English Channel
  towards Calais. In its progress it was attacked by the English fleet
  under Lord Howard, who, with his lieutenants, Drake, Hawkins, and
  Frobisher, endeavoured by dexterous seamanship and the discharge of
  well-directed volleys of shot to destroy or capture the vessels of the
  enemy. The great lumbering Spanish vessels suffered severely from their
  smaller opponents, which most of their shot missed. Arrived at length off
  Dunkirk, the armada was becalmed, thrown into confusion by fire-ships,
  and many of the Spanish vessels destroyed or taken. The Duke of
  Medina-Sidonia, owing to the severe losses, at last resolved to abandon
  the enterprise, and conceived the idea of reconveying his fleet to Spain
  by a voyage round the north of Great Britain; but storm after storm
  assailed his ships, scattering them in all directions, and sinking many.
  Some went down on the cliffs of Norway, others in the open sea, others on
  the Scottish coast, others on the coast of Ireland. In all, seventy-two
  large vessels and over 10,000 men were lost.&mdash;<span

  intermediate between the sloths and ant-eaters. They are covered with a
  hard bony shell, divided into belts, composed of small separate plates
  like a coat of mail, flexible everywhere except on the forehead,
  shoulders, and haunches, where it is not movable. The belts are connected
  by a membrane which enables the animal to roll itself up like a hedgehog.
  These animals burrow in the earth, where they lie during the daytime,
  seldom going abroad except at night. They are of different sizes: the
  largest, <i>Dasypus gigas</i>, being 3 feet in length without the tail,
  and the smallest only 10 inches. They subsist chiefly on fruits and
  roots, sometimes on insects and flesh. They are inoffensive, and their
  flesh is esteemed good food.&mdash;There is a genus of isopodous
  Crustacea called Armadillo, consisting of animals allied to the
  wood-lice, capable of rolling themselves into a ball.</p>

  the modern Lejjun: used figuratively in the <i>Apocalypse</i> to signify
  the place of 'the battle of the great day of God'. It may, however, be
  <i>har migdo</i>, his fruitful mountain, 'the mountain land of Israel'.
  The phrase 'an Armageddon' expresses any great slaughter or final
  conflict, and has been frequently applied to the Great War of 1914-8.
  During this war severe fighting took place in Sept., 1918, on the field
  of Armageddon, the entrance to the passes of Megiddo. The battle ended in
  an overwhelming victory for General Allenby's armies. See

  the province of Gascony, some of the counts of which hold prominent
  places in the history of France. Bernard VII, son of John II, surnamed
  the Hunchback, succeeded his brother, John III, in 1391, and was called
  to Court by Isabella of Bavaria, with the view of heading the Orleans in
  opposition to the Burgundian faction, where he no sooner gained the
  ascendancy than he compelled the queen to appoint him Constable of
  France. He showed himself a merciless tyrant, and became so generally
  execrated that the Duke of Burgundy, to whom Isabella had turned for
  help, found little difficulty in gaining admission into Paris, and even
  seizing the person of Armagnac, who was cast into prison in 1418, when
  the exasperated populace burst in and killed him and his followers. John
  V, grandson of the above, who succeeded in 1450, made himself notorious
  for his crimes. He was assassinated in his castle of Lectoure in 1473 by
  an agent of Louis XI, against whom he was holding out.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´mature</b>, a term applied to the piece of soft iron which is
  placed across the poles of permanent or electro-magnets for the purpose
  of receiving and concentrating the attractive force. In the case of
  permanent magnets it is also important for preserving their magnetism
  when not in use, and hence it is sometimes termed the <i>keeper</i>. It
  produces this effect in virtue of the well-known law of induction, by
  which the armature, when placed near or across the poles of the magnet,
  is itself converted into a temporary magnet with reversed poles, and
  these, reacting upon the permanent magnet, keep its particles in a state
  of constant magnetic tension, or, in other words, in that constrained
  position which is supposed to constitute magnetism. A horse-shoe magnet
  should therefore never be laid aside without its armature; and in the
  case of straight bar-magnets two should be placed parallel to each other,
  with their poles reversed, and a keeper or armature across them at both
  ends. The term is also applied to the core and coil of the
  electro-magnet, which revolves before the poles of the permanent magnet
  in the magneto-electric machine.</p>

  <p><b>Arme Blanche</b>, a term applied to the rapier and duelling-foil,
  and frequently also to all weapons other than fire-arms. The phrase is
  particularly applied to the sabres and lances carried by cavalry, but
  also to the bayonet.</p>

  <p><b>Arme´nia</b>, a mountainous country of Western Asia, of great
  historical interest as the original seat of one of the oldest civilized
  peoples in the <!-- Page 243 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page243"></a>[243]</span>world. The name Armenia occurs in the
  <i>Vulgate</i>, but the Hebrew name is Ararat. It has an area of about
  120,000 sq. miles, and is intersected by the Euphrates, which divides it
  into the ancient divisions, Armenia Major and Armenia Minor. The country
  is an elevated plateau, enclosed on several sides by the ranges of Taurus
  and Anti-Taurus, and partly occupied by other mountains, the loftiest of
  which is Ararat. Several important rivers take their rise in Armenia,
  namely, the Kur or Cyrus, and its tributary the Aras or Araxes, flowing
  east to the Caspian Sea; the Halys or Kizil-Irmak, flowing north to the
  Black Sea; and the Tigris and Euphrates, which flow into the Persian
  Gulf. The chief lakes are Van and Urumiyah. The climate is rather severe.
  The soil is on the whole productive, though in many places it would be
  quite barren were it not for the great care taken to irrigate it. Wheat,
  barley, tobacco, hemp, grapes, and cotton are raised; and in some of the
  valleys apricots, peaches, mulberries, and walnuts are grown. The
  inhabitants are chiefly of the genuine Armenian stock, a branch of the
  Aryan or Indo-European race; but besides them, in consequence of the
  repeated subjugation of the country, various other races have obtained a
  footing. The total number of Armenians is estimated at 2,900,000, of whom
  one-half are in Armenia. The remainder, like the Jews, are scattered over
  various countries, and are generally engaged in commercial pursuits. They
  everywhere retain, however, their distinct nationality.</p>

  <p>Little is known of the early history of Armenia, but it was a separate
  State as early as the eighth century <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, when
  it became subject to Assyria, as it also did subsequently to the Medes
  and the Persians. It was conquered by Alexander the Great in 325 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, but regained its independence about 190 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> Its king, Tigranes, son-in-law of the celebrated
  Mithrid&#x101;tes, was defeated by the Romans under Lucullus and Pompey
  between 69-66 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, but was left on the throne.
  Since then its fortunes have been various under the Romans, Parthians,
  Byzantine emperors, Persians, Saracens, and Turks. Until quite recently
  Armenia had no political existence, having been partitioned between
  Turkey, Persia, and Russia, the last acquiring considerable portions in
  1829 and 1878. The hope of the Armenians to see their country formed into
  an autonomous province administered by Christians was frustrated by the
  Treaty of Berlin in 1878. The advanced party amongst the Armenians,
  therefore, determined to obtain their object by the production of
  disturbances and the spread of a revolutionary movement. The Porte
  retaliated by wholesale massacres of the Armenians in 1896, 1904, and
  1908. The Armenian revolutionary and national parties in the meantime
  continued their activity and propaganda. Armenia proclaimed its
  independence in Aug., 1918. In Jan., 1920, the Supreme Council of the
  Allied Governments recognized the Armenian Republic of Erivan. A mandate
  for Armenia was also offered to the United States of America, but it was
  refused by the American Senate in May, 1920. On 18th March, 1922, Soviet
  Russia concluded a treaty with Turkey, giving to the latter most of
  Armenia. Batum was attached to Georgia. See <i>Erivan</i>, <i>Russia</i>,
  <i>Turkey</i>.</p>

  <p>The Armenians received Christianity at an early date, most probably at
  the beginning of the third century, although native historians maintain
  that several of the apostles preached in Armenia. The real apostle of
  Armenia was Gregory the Illuminator, in the third century. During the
  Monophysitic disputes they held with those who rejected the twofold
  nature of Christ, and being dissatisfied with the decisions of the
  Council of Chalcedon (451) they separated from the Greek Church in 536.
  The Popes had at different times attempted to gain them over to the Roman
  Catholic faith, but have not been able to unite them permanently and
  generally with the Roman Church. There are, however, small numbers here
  and there of United Armenians, who acknowledge the spiritual supremacy of
  the Pope, agree in their doctrines with the Catholics, but retain their
  peculiar ceremonies and discipline. But the far greater part are yet
  Monophysites, and have remained faithful to their old religion and
  worship. Their doctrine differs from the orthodox chiefly in their
  admitting only one nature in Christ, and believing the Holy Spirit to
  proceed from the Father alone. Their sacraments are seven in number. They
  adore saints and their images, but do not believe in purgatory. Their
  hierarchy differs little from that of the Greeks. The <i>Catholicus</i>,
  or head of the Church, has his seat at Etchmiadzin, a monastery near
  Erivan, the capital of former Russian Armenia, on Mount Ararat.</p>

  <p>The Armenian language belongs to the Indo-European family of
  languages, and is most closely connected with the Iranic group. The Old
  Armenian or Haikan language, which is still the literary and
  ecclesiastical language, is distinguished from the New Armenian, the
  ordinary spoken language, which contains a large intermixture of Persian
  and Turkish elements. The most flourishing period of Armenian literature
  extended from the fourth to the fourteenth century. It then declined, but
  a revival began in the seventeenth century, and at the present day
  wherever any extensive community of Armenians has settled they have set
  up a printing-press. The Armenian Bible, translated from a Syriac
  version, and revised by means of <!-- Page 244 --><span

  the Lys. The town had extensive manufactures of linen and cotton goods
  and an extensive trade. The Germans captured Armentières by massed
  assault early in April, 1918, after methodically shelling the town for
  about two years and destroying almost every building in it. The enemy's
  offensive was intended to achieve greater results. Indeed, its object was
  to break through to the Channel ports. It began on 9th April, after
  artillery preparation, from La Bassée to Armentières. When, however, the
  battle of Armentières died down, the enemy plan to break through to the
  coast had been definitely and finally frustrated. German losses were
  extremely heavy, their attacks having been made with massed troops. (See

  of the young king, Gustavus IV, and was deprived of all his titles and
  possessions. He was restored to his fortune and honours in 1799, when
  Gustavus IV attained his majority, and held several high military posts.
  Ultimately, however, he entered the Russian service, was made count,
  chancellor of the University of Abo, president of the department for the

  <p><b>Armin´ians</b>, a sect or party of Christians, so called from
  Jacobus <i>Arminius</i> or Harmensen. (See <i>Arminius</i>.) They were
  called also <i>Remonstrants</i>, from their having presented a
  <i>remonstrance</i> to the States-general in 1610. The Arminian doctrines
  are: (1) Conditional election and reprobation, in opposition to absolute
  predestination. (2) Universal redemption, or that the atonement was made
  by Christ for all mankind, though none but believers can be partakers of
  the benefit. (3) That man, in order to exercise true faith, must be
  regenerated and renewed by the operation of the Holy Spirit, which is the
  gift of God; but that this grace is not irresistible and may be lost, so
  that men may relapse from a state of grace and die in their sins.
  Arminianism being a revolt against certain aspects of Calvinism,
  especially the absolutism of the eternal decrees, its doctrines were
  vehemently attacked by the Calvinists of Holland, and were condemned by
  the Synod of Dort in 1619. The Arminians, in consequence, were treated
  with great severity; many of them fled to, and spread in, other
  countries, and though there is no longer any particular sect to which the
  name is exclusively applied, many bodies are classed as Arminians, as
  being opposed to the Calvinists on the question of
  predestination.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: Regenboog,

  fellow-countrymen as their deliverer from the Roman yoke, born about
  18-16 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, assassinated <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 19. Having been sent as a hostage to Rome, he
  served in the Roman army, and was raised to the rank of <i>eques</i>.
  Returning home, he found the Roman governor, Quintilius Varus, making
  efforts to Romanize the German tribes near the Rhine. Placing himself at
  the head of the discontented tribes he completely annihilated the army of
  Varus, consisting of three legions, in a three days' battle fought in the
  Teutoburg Forest. For some time he baffled the Roman general Germanicus,
  and after many years' resistance to the vast power of the Empire he drew
  upon himself the hatred of his countrymen by aiming at the regal
  authority, and was assassinated. A national monument to his memory was
  inaugurated on the Grotenburg, near Detmold, in 1875.&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Arminius</b>, Jacobus (properly Jakob Harmensen), founder of the
  sect of Arminians or Remonstrants, born in South Holland in 1560, died
  1609. He studied at Utrecht, in the University of Leyden, and at Geneva,
  where his chief preceptor in theology was Theodore Beza (1582). On his
  return to Holland he was appointed minister of one of the churches in
  <!-- Page 245 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page245"></a>[245]</span>Amsterdam, and chosen to undertake the
  refutation of a work which strongly controverted Beza's doctrine of
  predestination; but he happened to be convinced by the work which he had
  undertaken to refute. Elected in 1603 professor of divinity at Leyden, he
  openly declared his opinions, and was involved in harassing
  controversies, especially with his fellow professor Gomarus. These
  contests, with the continual attacks on his reputation, at length
  impaired his health and brought on a complicated disease, of which he
  died. See <i>Arminians</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´mitage</b>, Edward, English historical painter, born 1817, died
  1896. He studied under Delaroche at the École des Beaux Arts, Paris, was
  one of the ablest pupils of that painter, and in 1842 exhibited at the
  Salon (in the Louvre) a picture of <i>Prometheus Bound</i>. At the
  exhibition of cartoons for historical pictures in Westminster Hall (1843)
  he obtained a premium of £300 for his design of <i>Cæsar's First Invasion
  of Britain</i>. Other similar premiums were gained by his <i>Spirit of
  Religion</i> (1845), and <i>Battle of Meeanee</i> (1847&mdash;£500). He
  now went to study at Rome, and exhibited at the Academy in 1848 his
  <i>Henry VIII and Katherine Parr</i>, and his <i>Trafalgar</i> (<i>Death
  of Nelson</i>). He had pictures in most of the subsequent Academy
  exhibitions up nearly to the time of his death. In 1867 he was elected an
  associate, and in 1872 a full academician. He did much for the
  restoration of fresco painting in England. A large number of his pictures
  were biblical in subject, such as <i>Ahab and Jezebel</i>, <i>Esther's
  Banquet</i>, <i>The Remorse of Judas</i>, <i>Joseph and Mary</i>,
  <i>Herod's Birthday Feast</i>, &amp;c. As professor of painting to the
  Royal Academy he delivered lectures on painting, which were published in
  1883. In 1898 appeared a volume of his <i>Pictures and Drawings</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Armor´ica</b> (from two Celtic words signifying 'upon the sea'), a

  manned machine. The idea is a very ancient one, some form of protected
  vehicle having been in use among the Chinese in almost prehistoric times.
  The modern armoured car is constructed on a strongly-engined chassis, and
  is provided with a bullet-proof armour-plating both for engine and crew.
  This armour is continued low down over the wheels. The armament of such a
  car consists of two heavy machine-guns, firing through slits in the

  <p><b>Arms</b> and <b>Armour</b>. The former term is applied to weapons
  of offence, the latter to the various articles of defensive covering used
  in war and military exercises, especially before the introduction of
  gunpowder. Weapons of offence are divisible into two distinct
  sections&mdash;firearms, and arms used without gunpowder or other
  explosive substance. The first arms of offence would probably be wooden
  clubs, then would follow wooden weapons made more deadly by means of
  stone or bone, stone axes, <!-- Page 246 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page246"></a>[246]</span>slings, bows and arrows with heads of
  flint or bone, and afterwards various weapons of bronze. Subsequently a
  variety of arms of iron and steel was introduced, which comprised the
  sword, javelin, pike, spear or lance, dagger, axe, mace, chariot scythe,
  &amp;c.; with a rude artillery consisting of catapults, ballistæ, and
  battering-rams. From the descriptions of Homer we know that almost all
  the Grecian armour, defensive and offensive, in his time was of bronze;
  though iron was sometimes used. The lance, spear, and javelin were the
  principal weapons of this age among the Greeks. The bow is not often
  mentioned. Among ancient nations the Egyptians seem to have been most
  accustomed to the use of the bow, which was the principal weapon of the
  Egyptian infantry. Peculiar to the Egyptians was a defensive weapon
  intended to catch and break the sword of the enemy. With the Assyrians
  the bow was a favourite weapon; but with them lances, spears, and
  javelins were in more common use than with the Egyptians. Most of the
  large engines of war&mdash;chariots with scythes projecting at each side
  from the axle, catapults, and ballistæ&mdash;seem to have been of
  Assyrian origin. During the historical age of Greece the characteristic
  weapon was a heavy spear from 21 to 24 feet in length. The sword used by
  the Greeks was short, and was worn on the right side. The Roman sword was
  from 22 to 24 inches in length, straight, two-edged, and obtusely
  pointed, and as by the Greeks was worn on the right side. It was used
  principally as a stabbing weapon. It was originally of bronze. The most
  characteristic weapon of the Roman legionary soldier, however, was the
  <i>pilum</i>, which was a kind of pike or javelin, some 6 feet or more in
  length. The pilum was sometimes used at close quarters, but more commonly
  it was thrown. The favourite weapons of the ancient Germanic races were
  the battle-axe, the lance or dart, and the sword. The weapons of the
  Anglo-Saxons were spears, axes, swords, knives, and maces or clubs. The
  Normans had similar weapons, and were well furnished with archers and
  cavalry. The cross-bow was a comparatively late invention introduced by
  the Normans. Gunpowder was not used in Europe to discharge projectiles
  till the beginning of the fourteenth century. Cannon are first mentioned
  in England in 1338, and there seems to be no doubt that they were used by
  the English at the siege of Cambrai in 1339. The projectiles first used
  for cannon were of stone. Hand fire-arms date from the fifteenth century.
  At first they required two men to serve them, and it was necessary to
  rest the muzzle on a stand in aiming and firing. The first improvement
  was the invention of the match-lock, about 1476; this was followed by the
  wheel-lock, and about the middle of the seventeenth century by the
  flint-lock, which was in universal use until it was superseded by the
  percussion-lock, the invention of a Scottish clergyman early in the
  nineteenth century. The needle-gun dates from 1838. The only important
  weapon not a fire-arm that has been invented since the introduction of
  gunpowder is the bayonet, which is believed to have been invented about
  1650. See <i>Cannon</i>, <i>Musket</i>, <i>Rifle</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Some kind of defensive covering was probably of almost as early
  invention as weapons of offence. The principal pieces of defensive armour
  used by the ancients were shields, helmets, cuirasses, and greaves. In
  the earliest ages of Greece the shield is described as of immense size,
  but in the time of the Peloponnesian War (about 420 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>) it was much smaller. The Romans had two sorts
  of shields: the <i>scutum</i>, a large oblong rectangular <!-- Page 247
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page247"></a>[247]</span>highly-convex
  shield, carried by the legionaries; and the <i>parma</i>, a small round
  or oval flat shield, carried by the light-armed troops and the cavalry.
  In the declining days of Rome the shields became larger and more varied
  in form. The helmet was a characteristic piece of armour among the
  Assyrians, Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans. Like all other body armour it
  was usually made of bronze. The helmet of the historical age of Greece
  was distinguished by its lofty crest. The Roman helmet in the time of the
  early emperors fitted close to the head, and had a neck-guard and hinged
  cheek-pieces fastened under the chin, and a small bar across the face for
  a visor. Both Greeks and Romans wore cuirasses, at one time of bronze,
  but afterwards of flexible materials. Greaves for the legs were worn by
  both, but among the Romans usually on one leg. The ancient Germans had
  large shields of plaited osier covered with leather; afterwards their
  shields were small, bound with iron, and studded with bosses. The
  Anglo-Saxons had round or oval shields of wood, covered with leather, and
  having a boss in the centre; and they had also corselets, or coats of
  mail, strengthened with iron rings. The Normans were well protected by
  mail; their shields were somewhat triangular in shape, their helmets
  conical. In Europe generally metal armour was used from the tenth to the
  eighteenth century, and at first consisted of a tunic made of iron rings
  firmly sewn flat upon strong cloth or leather. The rings were afterwards
  interlinked one with another so as to form a garment of themselves,
  called <i>chain-mail</i>. Another variety of this flexible armour was
  known as <i>banded-mail</i>. This consisted of rings sewn upon a fabric
  foundation, the whole being covered with leather. In addition to this,
  'scale armour', which had been in use from the very earliest periods of
  history, was still in common fashion in the thirteenth century. By
  degrees the suit of mail was reinforced by the addition of pieces of
  plate on the breast, knees, elbows, and arms, and by the end of the
  fourteenth century the full suit of plate had been evolved, the mail
  being only worn as a skirt round the waist or as a coif attached to the
  helmet. The golden age of plate armour is the middle of the fifteenth
  century, when the design was light and graceful, and at the same time
  fully protective. In the sixteenth century, when 'shock tactics' of
  cavalry were the order of the day, the 'war harness' became heavier. This
  was particularly noticeable in the armour for the joust or tournament, in
  which sport the aim of the contestants was to score points and not to
  inflict injury. Many of these jousting armours weigh over 80 lb. The
  weapons in use through the whole of the plate-armour period were the
  lance, the sword, the axe or war-hammer, the long-bow, and the cross-bow.
  The introduction of fire-arms in the fourteenth century was one of the
  causes which led to the increase of weight in armour, for the armourer
  was continually improving and strengthening his products to make them
  proof against musket and pistol, and he generally succeeded, but by doing
  so increased the weight till it became insupportable. In the seventeenth
  century leg armour was abandoned, and by the end of the civil war the
  popular defence was the steel cap and breastplate. In the eighteenth
  century armour entirely disappeared, except for ceremonial, and was
  thought to be entirely obsolete till it was revived in the recent war in
  the form of the steel shrapnel-helmet, which was favoured by all the
  Allies and also by the enemy. The German troops occasionally used heavy
  body armour. Daggers and clubs, weapons likewise thought <!-- Page 248
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248"></a>[248]</span>to be
  obsolete, were frequently used by all combatants, especially on
  raids.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: A. Hutton, <i>The

  <p><b>Armstrong</b>, John, Scottish poet and physician, born about 1709,
  died 1779. After studying medicine in Edinburgh he settled in London. In
  1744 he published his chief work, the <i>Art of Preserving Health</i>, a
  didactic poem. This work raised his reputation to a height which his
  subsequent efforts scarcely sustained. In 1746 he became physician to a
  hospital for soldiers, and in 1760 he was appointed physician to the
  forces which went to Germany. After his return to London he published a
  collection of his <i>Miscellanies</i>, which contained, however, nothing
  valuable. He afterwards visited France and Italy, and published an
  account of his tour under the name of Lancelot Temple. His last
  production was a volume of <i>Medical Essays</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Armstrong</b>, William George, Lord, engineer and mechanical
  inventor, born at Newcastle-on-Tyne, 10th Nov., 1810. He was trained as a
  solicitor, and practised as such for some time. Among his early
  inventions were the hydro-electric machine, a powerful apparatus for
  producing frictional electricity, and the hydraulic crane. In 1847 the
  Elswick works, near Newcastle, were established for the manufacture of
  his cranes and other heavy iron machinery, and these works are now among
  the most extensive of their kind. Here the first rifled ordnance gun
  which bears his name was made in 1854. His improvements in the
  manufacture of guns and shells led to his being appointed engineer of
  rifled ordnance under Government, and he was knighted in 1858. This
  appointment came to an end in 1863, since which time his ordnance has
  taken a prominent place in the armaments of different countries. He was
  made a peer, as Baron Armstrong, in 1887. He died 27th Dec., 1900.</p>

  <p><b>Armstrong Gun</b>, a kind of cannon, so called from its inventor.
  It has an inner tube or core of steel, rifled with numerous shallow
  grooves, the tube being surrounded by a jacket of spirally-coiled bars of
  wrought iron, so disposed as to bring the metal into the most favourable
  position for the strain to which it is to be exposed. His first guns were
  small, but larger ones were soon made, and afterwards those of the very
  highest calibre. The breech-loading principle was also adopted in them,
  and special provision to effect this satisfactorily was invented by him.
  The improved shells introduced by him were of the elongated and pointed
  type now so well known, the charge being inserted in a special chamber
  behind the bore.</p>

  <p><b>Army</b>, a collection of bodies of men armed, disciplined, and
  organized for war. The essence of a modern army is that it shall be
  composed of organized units each under its own commander, grouped in
  formations of ever-increasing size, and owing allegiance through these
  commanders to one supreme head. Discipline and organization are
  essential, or such a force becomes merely a collection of armed men.</p>

  <p>In the early days of our history every able-bodied man was, to a
  greater or lesser extent, a possible fighting man, and all had arms of
  one kind or another. Consequently, when an army was required, landowners
  and county authorities were ordered to provide the troops necessary.
  Every free landowner between the ages of sixteen and sixty was liable to
  service, which was limited to two months in a year. This was the Saxon
  'fyrd' system. Later it was improved on by the institution of 'Thane's
  Service', which made it incumbent on the more considerable landowners to
  appear fully armed and mounted, and to serve for the whole campaign. The
  horse, however, was only used as a means of locomotion: for fighting
  purposes their riders dismounted, as did the dragoons of the seventeenth
  century and the mounted infantry of still more modern times. The fyrd was
  an unorganized and undisciplined force and entirely ephemeral in its
  nature, so that we find the Danish kings of England casting about for
  some more permanent force, which came into existence under the title of
  the 'House Carles', or Royal Guard. With the Norman Conquest the fyrd was
  largely supplanted by the feudal system of knight's service, according to
  which the country was divided into knight's fees, each of which had to
  provide its quotum of men. The gradual appearance of the custom of
  avoiding service by payments of money&mdash;in time regulated under the
  name of scutage&mdash;led to the employment of paid mercenaries, who for
  some two centuries were almost invariably foreigners. In the twelfth
  century it was found that sufficient troops could not be provided under
  these two systems, so the fyrd was re-established as a National Militia
  by the Assize of Arms, and in the next century further steps were taken
  to protect it under the Statute of Winchester. In the fourteenth century
  the archer, with his longbow, became a very important part of the
  fighting forces of England, and an army of those days consisted of the
  heavily-armed and armoured knights and men-at-arms for shock action, and
  the unarmoured archers for 'volley action', to use a later term. With the
  gradual disappearance of the foreign mercenaries, it became the custom
  for the king to issue indents to certain influential subjects for the
  raising of paid troops. <!-- Page 249 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page249"></a>[249]</span>From this custom arose the free companies,
  which, in time, became nothing more or less than commercial undertakings.
  The indents were accepted, and the men enlisted primarily for what could
  be got out of the business of fighting, either in the shape of ransom or
  the sack of towns. Some attempt was also made at tactical organization,
  and an army of the period was divided into vanguard, battle, and
  rearguard. Artillery also was beginning to be developed in Germany for
  siege purposes. The sixteenth century saw the first formation of
  companies into regiments, though as yet of no fixed strength. Arms were
  also modernized, and by the end of the century muskets, 18-feet pikes,
  and swords, were the arms of infantry instead of the varied assortment of
  halberds, pikes, muskets, harquebuses, and longbows common at the
  beginning. Elizabeth introduced the press-gang as an aid to recruiting,
  and abolished the white coat of the soldier in favour of a long red or
  blue cassock. In the next century Cromwell's new model army became the
  first standing army of England, and, though it was disbanded by Act of
  Parliament at the Restoration, one of its
  regiments&mdash;Monk's&mdash;remained, and is now the Coldstream Guards.
  After this regiments were raised from time to time on one pretext or
  another, and the nucleus of a standing army became a <i>fait
  accompli</i>, though it was for a long time considered more as an
  appanage of the king than as a national institution. With the standing
  army came the first beginnings of civilian control, a Secretary-at-War
  being appointed in 1660. He had, however, no responsibility, and was
  subordinate to the commander-in-chief, and it was not till 1710 that he
  assumed his present responsibility to Parliament. During the eighteenth
  century the strength of the army rose or fell according to the state of
  the military barometer and the success or otherwise of the various
  recruiting expedients, among which was the first attempt at a
  short-service system in 1703. In 1871-2 the old numbering in regiments
  was abolished and a territorial designation substituted. According to
  this scheme, the first twenty-five regiments, all of which had already
  two battalions, were grouped together, the rest being joined arbitrarily
  to form new regiments under county designations. With these regiments
  were affiliated the militia and volunteer battalions, which have now been
  amalgamated into the Special Reserve and the Territorial Force.</p>

  <p>For the requirements of the war of 1914-8 the Empire, as a whole,
  including India, raised and maintained a total of 8,654,467 men, of which
  the contribution of the United Kingdom was over 6,000,000. Casualties for
  the whole Empire were 3,060,616, of which the United Kingdom has for her
  share nearly 2,500,000, including 666,083 killed, 1,644,786 wounded, and
  140,312 missing.</p>

  <p>During 1918 the combatant strength of all arms of the British army in
  France fluctuated between 1,293,000 in March and 1,164,790 in November,
  while the rifle or infantry strength was from 616,000 to 416,748 during
  the same periods. From the date of the armistice to 31st Dec., 1919, the
  following number of demobilizations and discharges were
  effected:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Demobilized.&mdash;Officers, 144,144; other ranks, 3,332,882.</p>

  <p>Discharged as medically unfit.&mdash;Officers, 23,476; other ranks,
  207,500.</p>

  <p>Discharged from reserves.&mdash;Other ranks, 143,603.</p>

  <p>The modern British army is governed by the Army Council (instituted
  1904), presided over by the Secretary of State for War. This Council,
  which consists of five military and five civilian members, including the
  president, works through the War Office, of which the principal
  departments are in charge of one or other of the members of the Council.
  On the military side these departments are those of the Chief of the
  Imperial General Staff, the Adjutant-General to the Forces, the
  Quartermaster-General to the Forces, and the Master-General of the
  Ordnance. For administrative and training purposes the United Kingdom is
  divided into seven Commands and the London District. When necessary,
  Commands are further subdivided into Districts. The army, generally
  speaking, consists of (1) the Regular Army, (2) the Territorial Force,
  and (3) the Reserves. The service battalions, which formed such a large
  and important part of the army in the war, do not, properly speaking,
  form part of the permanent military forces, though the organization of
  the army as a whole is such that it is capable of expansion to any extent
  by the process of raising new battalions and affiliating them to existing
  regular or territorial units. The regular army comprises the Household
  Cavalry, Cavalry of the Line, the Royal Regiment of Artillery, the Corps
  of Royal Engineers, the Brigade of Guards, and Infantry of the Line. In
  addition there are administrative troops and services such as the Royal
  Army Service Corps, the Royal Army Medical Corps, with its allied service
  Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service, the Royal Army
  Ordnance Corps, and others. Other corps brought into existence during the
  war, such as the Tank and Machine-gun Corps, have at present no permanent
  status. In the future, however, machine-gun companies will form an
  integral portion of each battalion of the regular army.</p>

  <p>Under the conditions of the war the old national method of voluntary
  recruitment was <!-- Page 250 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page250"></a>[250]</span>found to be insufficient, and recourse was
  had to the principle of universal military service. Under the Military
  Service Acts the age limit was gradually raised till it finally included
  all men up to the age of fifty. Exceptions were made in the case of
  munition-workers, or those employed on work of national importance. Since
  the signature of the Treaty of Peace the army so raised was gradually
  demobilized till, by 31st March, 1920, it had decreased to 400,000,
  including 100,000 Indians paid by the Imperial Government. Concurrently
  with demobilization, voluntary enlistment was reintroduced, and the
  post-war army is once more a voluntary one, in which men serve under very
  much improved conditions as to pay and prospects. The period of service
  under this system is twelve years, of which seven normally are with the
  colours and five in the reserve: in certain cases modifications of these
  periods are allowed, and, in addition, a soldier may be allowed to extend
  his colour service to the full twelve years, or, in exceptional cases, to
  complete twenty-one years for pension. Discharge or transfer to the
  reserve is ordinarily granted on completion of the agreed period of
  service. Pay of all ranks was very materially improved in 1919. Whereas
  formerly a private soldier on enlistment received 1<i>s.</i> a day, he
  now receives 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, and after two years' service
  3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> To this last amount is added, under very reasonable
  conditions, a further daily sum of 6<i>d.</i> proficiency pay. A sergeant
  now gets 7<i>s.</i> a day instead of from 2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to
  3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, and a regimental sergeant-major 14<i>s.</i>
  instead of 5<i>s.</i> or 6<i>s.</i> Add to these rates of pay free
  rations, free housing, free medical attendance, and, in the future,
  doubtless free education, and it must be admitted that the present-day
  soldier is not badly paid. The rate of pay is a flat rate for all arms,
  special allowances being given where necessary.</p>

  <p>The Household Cavalry comprises the 1st and 2nd Life Guards and the
  Horse Guards (Blues). In peace-time they serve only in London and
  Windsor. They alone retain the old cavalry rank of corporal of horse
  instead of sergeant. Cavalry of the line consists of dragoon guards,
  dragoons, hussars, and lancers. The dragoon guards are numbered
  separately from 1 to 7, while dragoons, hussars, and lancers run
  consecutively from 1 to 21. A regiment of cavalry is commanded by a
  lieutenant-colonel and consists of 25 officers and 497 other ranks. Each
  regiment is organized in three squadrons commanded by majors, while a
  squadron is divided into four troops, each under a subaltern officer,
  troops being further subdivided into sections under non-commissioned
  officers. Cavalry regiments, except hussars, carry guidons or standards
  for ceremonial purposes. These differ from the colours of infantry in
  that they are not consecrated and are carried by non-commissioned
  officers instead of by officers. Hussars carry no standards. There are
  six cavalry depots for recruiting and preliminary-training purposes, i.e.
  for lancers at Woolwich, hussars at Scarborough, Bristol, and Dublin, and
  dragoons at Newport (Mon.) and Dunbar. The Cavalry Special Reserve
  consists of the Irish Horse and King Edward's Horse, and during the war
  reserve cavalry regiments were maintained.</p>

  <p>The Royal Regiment of Artillery comprises batteries of horse artillery
  designated by letters of the alphabet, and batteries of field, siege,
  heavy, and mountain by numbers. A battery, with some exceptions in the
  case of the heaviest type, consists of six guns or howitzers, horse
  artillery having 13-pounder guns, and field artillery 18-pounder guns or
  4.5-inch howitzers. Horse artillery is intended to act with cavalry, and
  is therefore provided with a rather lighter gun. It can go anywhere that
  cavalry can go, and all the gun detachments are mounted. Field artillery
  works with infantry, and the gun detachments either walk or are carried
  on the limbers, only the officers, certain non-commissioned officers, and
  specialists such as scouts, range-finders, and trumpeters being
  mounted.</p>

  <p>A battery is commanded by a major, with a captain as
  second-in-command, and is organized in three sections of two guns each
  under a subaltern. These sections are again subdivided into subsections
  of one gun each under a sergeant. Each gun is drawn by six horses, the
  driver of the leading pair being responsible for direction and pace. A
  corporal in the Royal Artillery is known as a bombardier, and the rank
  and file as gunners or drivers, according to their special duties, though
  drivers are also trained to some extent as gunners.</p>

  <p>Heavy and siege artillery have come into their own in the late war,
  and consist roughly of all armament heavier than that of field artillery.
  Sixty-pounders and 4.7-inch howitzers form heavy batteries, while guns of
  6 inch and upwards drawn by mechanical transport or mounted on railway
  trucks are known as siege batteries. Mountain artillery, of which most of
  the batteries are in India, is armed with 2.95-inch screw guns capable of
  being dismantled and carried piecemeal on mules. Another form is found on
  the west coast of Africa, where carriers take the place of mules. These
  guns are brought into action very quickly, but their shell-power is
  small.</p>

  <p>The corps of Royal Engineers is responsible for the construction and
  maintenance of barracks, fortifications, and other military works, and
  for the personnel required for search-lights and electrical
  communications of the coast and anti-aircraft defences. With few
  exceptions the personnel of the corps is recruited entirely from <!--
  Page 251 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page251"></a>[251]</span>skilled tradesmen and artisans. For
  service in the field, Royal Engineer units known as field squadrons and
  field companies accompany the fighting troops, and carry a certain amount
  of bridging material and tools. More highly specialized units carry out
  such services as mining, heavy bridging, railway, survey, and
  sound-ranging work. An important feature of Royal Engineer work in war is
  the supply of materials and stores, for which purpose an elaborate
  organization is provided in addition to the units already noted.</p>

  <p>The Brigade of Guards&mdash;the infantry of the household
  troops&mdash;comprises the five regiments of foot-guards. These are the
  Grenadier, the Coldstream, the Scots, the Irish, and the Welsh Guards of
  from one to three battalions each. Being household troops these regiments
  are subject to certain special regulations and have certain privileges.
  As a general rule they serve only in London, Windsor, or Aldershot, and
  only leave England for active service, though individual battalions have
  served in the past both in Cairo and Gibraltar.</p>

  <p>The infantry, of which there are sixty-eight regiments of from two to
  four battalions each, provides the bulk of the army. Infantry is formed
  into regiments for recruiting and territorial distribution purposes, but
  the battalion is the actual unit both for fighting and administration. In
  many cases the Army List gives the name of an officer holding the
  appointment of colonel of the regiment: this is in all cases a purely
  honorary appointment and entails no duties or responsibilities. An
  infantry battalion is commanded by a lieutenant-colonel and consists of
  32 officers and 1000 other ranks. Both in peace and war a battalion is
  divided into head-quarters and four companies, each of the latter having
  six officers, including the company commander, who is a major or senior
  captain. Subalterns command platoons. For recruiting purposes for
  infantry of the line the country is divided into Regimental Districts, in
  which are located the depots of the regiment concerned: these depots are
  commanded by a senior officer of one of the battalions of the regiment
  with the necessary staff for training purposes. Recruits are usually
  first trained at the depot and later transferred to the battalion
  requiring them. The Regimental Districts are again combined into larger
  districts in which are situated the Record Offices dealing with the
  regiments of the district. The denomination of the district dealing with
  any particular regiment is shown in the Army List in brackets. The
  principles of interior organization are the same throughout the army, and
  as they can be best illustrated with the example of an infantry battalion
  a short description of this organization follows. Owing to the continual
  growth of military science, the improvement in arms and means of
  destruction generally, and the confusion and noise inseparable from a
  modern battle, the size of the personally-controlled unit has gradually
  decreased till, in the present day, in the British army, it is accepted
  as an axiom that no larger number of men than six can be conveniently
  controlled in battle by one man. In former days companies, battalions,
  and even larger formations were both controlled and received their
  executive orders direct from their commanders&mdash;and to such an extent
  was this carried that Fortescue, in his <i>History of the British
  Army</i>, notes that Marlborough was in the habit of putting his whole
  army through the platoon exercise by means of flags and bugle-calls.
  This, of course, was not actually in face of the enemy, but the principle
  is the same. The stress of modern war now makes individual control of
  large bodies impossible, and the British army is therefore organized both
  for peace and war in a series of units of ever-increasing size, each
  under its own commander, who is responsible to his immediate superior for
  the well-being, training, and leading of his command. Taking the infantry
  organization as an example, we find that in the lowest stage, that of the
  'section', the command is both personal and direct, in that the corporal
  controls and commands the six men composing his fighting unit personally
  and directly by word of mouth. In peace-time, and for administrative and
  training purposes, the section may reach to ten men, who live, work, and
  play together. In the next stage&mdash;that of the 'platoon', consisting
  of four sections&mdash;we find the control is rather less personal and
  direct, in that the platoon commander, a subaltern, controls his command
  largely through his subordinates, the section commanders. A further stage
  is that of the 'company', which consists of four platoons and company
  head-quarters. A company is commanded by a major or senior captain, has a
  captain as second-in-command, and a company sergeant-major and
  quartermaster-sergeant to assist in running it. Here again the control is
  less direct though still personal. The next stage is the amalgamation of
  companies into a battalion, consisting of a head-quarters and four
  companies. Battalion head-quarters consist of a lieutenant-colonel
  commanding, a major second-in-command, an adjutant, and a quartermaster.
  Certain other officers, when required, and the regimental sergeant-major
  and quartermaster-sergeant, and various other ranks make up the total of
  some 130. The commanding officer of a battalion is directly responsible
  for the well-being of his command, for its training, discipline,
  equipment, and general efficiency. In carrying on his duties he works
  through his company <!-- Page 252 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page252"></a>[252]</span>commanders, and with the assistance of the
  regimental staff mentioned above, so that we have a direct chain of
  command and responsibility from the corporal commanding a section of six
  to ten men through platoons and companies to the lieutenant-colonel
  commanding a battalion of some thousand men. A detail of armament made
  possible by the enormous increase of machine-guns necessitated during the
  war is interesting. Thirty-two Lewis-guns are now provided for each
  infantry battalion, and are distributed to alternate sections in a
  platoon. Thus in each platoon two sections are known as rifle sections
  and two as Lewis-gun sections, and these arms are normally used by the
  respective sections; but men of all sections are trained in the use of
  both rifle and Lewis-gun.</p>

  <p>When we come to formations larger than a battalion, we find the system
  of control and command becoming less and less personal and direct, as in
  all such formations the commander works to a less or greater extent
  through his staff. Roughly speaking, the staff is of two divisions, the
  one consisting of the general staff branch and the other of the branch of
  the adjutant and quartermaster-general. Again speaking very generally,
  the general staff is charged with duties bearing directly on military
  operations, while officers of the adjutant and quartermaster-general's
  branch deal more with administrative questions. Officers of the general
  staff are known as general staff officers, while those of the other
  branch are called, for example, assistant or deputy-assistant adjutant or
  quartermaster-general, according to their several duties.</p>

  <p>The formation in which distinct and separate units are first collected
  under one superior commander is known as a brigade. This, according to
  present establishment, consists of three battalions and a trench-mortar
  battery, the whole under a general officer called a brigadier-general,
  assisted by a staff of two officers&mdash;a brigade-major and a
  staff-captain. Since March, 1920, however, the title of brigadier-general
  has been altered to 'colonel-commandant'. The strength of a brigade is
  something over 3000 of all ranks. In a division, which is the next
  highest formation, and which is commanded by a major-general with a staff
  of three general staff officers and three officers belonging to the A.G.
  and Q.M.G. branch, we find the first appearance of a mixed force. It is
  not a force of 'all arms', as cavalry is not included, but, in addition
  to infantry (three brigades), it has a considerable strength in
  artillery, besides engineers and the necessary administrative troops. Two
  or more divisions, together with a cavalry regiment and certain other
  troops, form an 'army corps', and two or more corps go to make up an
  'army'. These are not at present peace-time formations of the British
  army.</p>

  <p>Of the administrative troops and services already mentioned, the Royal
  Army Service Corps provides for the material wants of the army both in
  the way of food and transport. It is organized in companies designated by
  numerals.</p>

  <p>The Royal Army Medical Corps provides the personnel and organization
  for the medical and sanitary services of the army. In peace-time this
  service is organized on a garrison basis, hospitals being established
  where required for the use of all troops in that particular garrison. For
  war purposes medical officers are still attached to regiments, and in
  addition the corps provides the personnel and organization necessary for
  field ambulances, casualty clearing-stations, hospital trains and ships,
  and various classes of fixed hospitals. The corps is organized in
  numbered companies, and the rank and file are trained in first aid and
  ambulance duties generally. It is administered by a director-general of
  Army Medical Services with the rank of lieutenant-general, who is an
  officer of the adjutant-general's department.</p>

  <p>The other departments and administrative services of the army consist
  of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, dealing generally with munitions of
  war; the Army Pay Department; the Royal Army Chaplains' Department; and
  the Royal Army Veterinary Corps, of which the functions are sufficiently
  designated by their title. In addition, there are manufacturing
  establishments at Woolwich Arsenal and elsewhere.</p>

  <p>The Army Reserve consists of men who have completed their term of
  colour service, or service with a unit, and have thus passed into civil
  life, though still remaining liable for a period of years to be recalled
  to the colours if mobilization is ordered.</p>

  <p>The Special Reserve was formed under the Territorial and Reserve
  Forces Act of 1907 out of the old militia. It consists generally of one
  battalion to each regiment of infantry, and is numbered consecutively
  with regular battalions of the regiment. It will, in the future, probably
  be again known as the Militia.</p>

  <p>The Royal Marines&mdash;artillery and infantry, or the 'blue' and the
  'red' marines, Kipling's "soldier and sailor too"&mdash;are not part of
  the army proper, as they are administered entirely by the Admiralty. They
  are, however, amenable to the Army Act when serving ashore. The term of
  service is for twelve years, which may be extended to make up twenty-one.
  Men may be transferred to or from the army at their own request.</p>

  <p>The Territorial Force, or, as it is to be called in future, the
  Territorial Army, is raised entirely <!-- Page 253 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page253"></a>[253]</span>on a county or
  territorial basis. It was originally created by the Territorial and
  Reserve Forces Act of 1907 out of a nucleus of the old yeomanry and
  volunteers. It is raised and administered by County Associations in each
  county and principal city. These associations consist of a president,
  chairman, military representative, and co-opted members. The
  administration of the Territorial Army is carried out by the County
  Associations in accordance with schemes provided by the Army Council,
  while all questions of training are reserved to the War Office. The
  Territorial Army consists of all arms, including machine-gun corps and
  the necessary administrative services: its full war establishment is
  fixed at approximately 345,000 of all ranks, though, for the present,
  only some 60 per cent of them are to be enlisted. The rejuvenated
  Territorial Army is to be in all respects a true second line of imperial
  defence, self-contained and self-supporting, while the regular army and
  its special reserve of militia battalions form the first line. Defence
  entails a certain amount of offence to bring it to a successful issue: it
  has therefore been decided that the new Territorial Army will not be
  relegated merely to the duty of guarding the country from invasion, but
  will, in a national emergency, be entitled to take its place under its
  own organization in the fighting line in any part of the world where its
  services may be required. This will entail enlistment for general
  service, but the interest of the force and of individuals composing it
  are safeguarded by the proviso that before the Territorial Army can be
  ordered out of the country an Act authorizing the movement be passed by
  Parliament. It is further provided that the Territorial Army will on no
  account be called on to supply drafts for regular regiments, and that in
  case fresh regiments have to be raised on the lines of the New Army, the
  machinery of the Territorial Army will be used to organize them.
  Enlistment will be for three or four years, according to whether a man
  has served during the European War (1914-8) or not; age limits are
  normally between 18 and 38. The army is to be organized in one cavalry
  (yeomanry) division of 12 regiments, and 14 infantry divisions each under
  a selected general officer, either regular or territorial. Pay and
  allowances during training periods will be as in the regular army, and in
  addition certain bounties will be obtainable. Training periods will be
  fifteen days in camp annually, besides a minimum number of drills and a
  musketry course. On completion of colour service a man will pass to the
  Territorial Reserve.</p>

  <p>The New Army, consisting of the 'service battalions' of existing
  regiments, is a product of the war. When, on the outbreak of war, many
  new regiments were rapidly raised, they were affiliated to regular
  regiments with consecutive numbers after the territorial battalions, and
  this organization was continued and extended to cope with the personnel
  obtained under the Military Service Acts.</p>

  <p>Educational establishments connected with the army include the Staff
  College, the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, and the Royal Military
  Academy at Woolwich. At the Staff College officers obtain a course of
  instruction and study to fit them for service on the staff of the army.
  At Sandhurst, where the course of instruction is two years, some 700
  gentlemen cadets are trained for commissions in the guards, cavalry, and
  infantry of the line, and the Indian army. At Woolwich gentlemen cadets
  desirous of entering the Royal Artillery or the Royal Engineers receive
  their training. In addition to these there are schools of gunnery and
  engineering, the Small Arms School at Hythe, the School of Physical
  Training at Aldershot, and many others: while, for sons and orphans of
  soldiers, there are the Duke of York's Royal Military School and the
  Royal Hibernian School. The Royal Hospital, Chelsea, and the Royal
  Hospital, Kilmainham, Dublin, are institutions for the care of old and
  distressed soldiers. In every garrison there are garrison schools for
  soldiers under fully qualified army schoolmasters, while in the future
  there is likely to be a very great increase in educational facilities of
  all kinds for the rank and file of the army. The training of the British
  army for war now embraces a variety of subjects, and at the Royal
  Military College and Academy the gentlemen cadets are not only taught the
  principles and practice of their future profession, but are also
  instructed in the methods of imparting their knowledge to others. For
  example, the course of training at the Royal Military College embraces
  drill and weapon training&mdash;under which head is included musketry
  (both theory and practice) and bayonet work&mdash;physical training, and
  riding. As part of the physical-training course they receive instruction
  as to the best methods of organizing regimental assaults-at-arms and
  sports. Among the more academic subjects are military history and
  tactics, field sketching and topography, field engineering, military law
  and administration, and elementary hygiene. A great deal of practical
  work is done, and the course of two years is designed to fit a young
  officer, on joining his regiment, to undertake the entire charge and
  training of his troop or platoon. At the Royal Military Academy extra
  subjects, such as artillery work and more advanced engineering, are also
  taught.</p>

  <p>As to the soldier's training generally, drill is insisted on as an aid
  to discipline, which it <!-- Page 254 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page254"></a>[254]</span>undoubtedly is, and exact performance of
  the various movements ordered is expected. In other branches of training
  more individuality is allowed, and the days when the bayonet-exercise was
  performed by a battalion to the music of the regimental band having
  passed, considerable latitude as to positions and execution is permitted
  in this particular branch, attention being principally concentrated on
  inculcating the 'offensive spirit'. The modern soldier also learns how to
  use a Lewis-gun, to throw or fire a grenade, what to do in case of a gas
  attack, the rudiments of field engineering, and how to keep himself
  healthy.</p>

  <p>In addition to the more generally-known units of the army there are
  certain corps which, though raised in the colonies, still form part of
  the army, and which are administered by the imperial authorities. Under
  this head are the Royal Malta Artillery (local service); the West India
  Regiment (two battalions) and the West African Regiment, both for general
  service and both administered by the War Office. Among other colonial
  corps maintained by the imperial Government, though not forming part of
  the regular army, are the West African Frontier Force (Nigeria) and the
  King's African Rifles (East Africa). Both these are administered by the
  Colonial Office.</p>

  <p><i>Dominions.</i>&mdash;The military forces of the self-governing
  dominions are raised and organized under the laws of such dominions.</p>

  <p>Those of the Commonwealth of Australia are organized on a system of
  compulsory military training for all males between the ages of twelve and
  twenty-six. In the earlier stages boys are trained in cadet corps, from
  which they pass to the Citizen Army, and from there, having attained the
  age of twenty-six, to recognized rifle clubs. The annual period of
  training in the Citizen Army is sixteen days. When the scheme is in full
  working order this force will consist of twenty-three 4-battalion
  brigades of infantry, twenty-three regiments of light horse, fifty-six
  4-gun batteries, and the necessary complement of engineers and
  administrative troops. During the war this organization was in abeyance,
  and regiments were raised as required for overseas service, and, though
  proposals for conscription were negatived, the commonwealth still managed
  to send some 330,000 men to the various theatres of war out of 417,000
  raised. The casualties, killed, wounded, and missing, were 210,724.</p>

  <p>The Commonwealth also maintains a small permanent force of trained
  professional soldiers.</p>

  <p>The New Zealand forces are also organized on the principle of
  universal training for all males. The details differ somewhat from those
  in favour in Australia, but the principle is the same, i.e. that every
  male should be trained for home defence. Boys of from twelve to eighteen
  years of age are trained in cadet corps, from which they pass to
  regiments of the Territorial Force, and from twenty-five to thirty belong
  to the reserve. Cadets do annually a specified number of drills, while
  the territorial training extends to seven clear days, a musketry course,
  and certain drills every year. For the purposes of the war, conscription
  was introduced in 1916, and 220,000 men were raised between 1914 and
  1918, out of which the casualties were nearly 57,000.</p>

  <p>Canada, unlike Australia and New Zealand, has no system of graduated
  military training. The military forces of the dominion are organized as a
  militia under a Minister of Militia and Defence working with a Council.
  This militia is recruited by voluntary enlistment, and, on the outbreak
  of war, consisted of a permanent force of 3000 and some 60,000 men who
  had received militia training. This made possible the rapid dispatch to
  France of a division which, by 1916, had increased to a corps of four
  divisions and a cavalry brigade. Like the Mother Country and New Zealand,
  Canada introduced conscription in 1917, and during the war raised nearly
  641,000 men and suffered 206,149 casualties, of which 56,110 were killed,
  149,733 wounded, and 306 missing.</p>

  <p>The Union of South Africa divides its military forces into the
  permanent force and the citizen force. There is also a coast-defence
  force. The permanent force consists of the five regiments of the South
  African Mounted Rifles. South Africa's greatest military effort during
  the war was directed towards German South-West and East Africa, but some
  27,000 men were enlisted for and sent to Europe out of a total number of
  136,000 raised. This total does not include coloured troops. The
  casualties were 18,000.</p>

  <p>In other self-governing portions of the Empire troops were raised as
  required, and in the West and East African colonies the existing
  formations of native troops were considerably increased for service in
  suitable portions of the various theatres of war. The official statement
  of troops raised shows under the heading of 'other colonies' 134,837,
  including coloured troops from South Africa and the West Indies. The
  casualties among them amounted to 7519.</p>

  <p><i>The Army in India.</i>&mdash;The military forces in India consist
  of those units of British cavalry, artillery, and infantry temporarily
  serving in the country, and the Indian army proper, consisting of
  regiments recruited from among the native inhabitants and normally
  serving there. Enlistment is voluntary and for general service, one of
  the promises made by a man on enrolment being "to go wherever ordered by
  land and sea and not to allow caste usages to interfere with his duties
  as a soldier". The Indian army, as a disciplined and organized force,
  dates from the <!-- Page 255 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page255"></a>[255]</span>years between 1748 and 1758. In 1748 Major
  Stringer Lawrence arrived in Madras with a commission from the Company as
  commander-in-chief. His first act was to form the existing European
  independent companies into regiments; his second to raise certain native
  independent companies. In 1758 he formed these companies in their turn
  into battalions, which he designated 'coast sepoys', and which still
  exist under their present names of the 61st Pioneers and following
  numbers. His system was extended to the other presidencies, and at the
  period of the mutiny, in 1857, the native army in India consisted of some
  230,000 regular troops, besides irregulars. When the post-mutiny
  reconstruction took place, the army was reorganized on an irregular basis
  instead of as regular regiments on the British model. According to this
  new system, the number of British officers in a regiment was considerably
  reduced; native officers were given command of troops and companies,
  while the British officer's command became the squadron, or wing. Native
  artillery, with the exception of certain mountain batteries, was
  abolished, and cavalry was reconstituted on the Silladar system, whereby,
  in consideration of a larger monthly pay than was given to the infantry
  sepoy, the trooper, or sowar, provided his own horse and sword. The
  system thus introduced virtually remains to the present day, though it
  has been modified and improved to suit later conditions. The infantry
  officer's command has decreased from the wing of four companies to the
  double company of two, and it is now known as a company and is organized
  in four platoons on the British service model, platoons being commanded
  by Indian officers. Of late years the number of British officers with an
  Indian regiment has been increased to twelve, and at the present time a
  committee is sitting in India to deliberate on the future construction of
  the army. It is therefore impossible to give details of its future
  strength. This, just before the war, was some 160,000, organized in 38
  regiments of cavalry, the corps of guides, 3 regiments of sappers and
  miners, 118 regiments of infantry of 1 battalion each, and 10 regiments
  of Gurkhas of 2 battalions each. There were also 13 mountain batteries.
  The 'Imperial Service Troops', of which many contingents took part in the
  war, are raised, paid, and maintained by princes and chiefs as a
  contribution to the defence of the country, while their training is
  supervised by British inspecting officers. The 'Indian Defence Force',
  which has lately replaced the volunteers, and in which service is
  compulsory for Europeans, is available for home defence only. During the
  war India, by voluntary enlistment, provided 1,401,350 men. Of these many
  new regiments were formed, and second, third, and fourth battalions added
  to existing regiments. Casualties were very nearly 114,000, including
  some 48,000 killed. Native Indian officers of cavalry are known as
  ressaldars, ressaiders, and jemadars, while those of the infantry are
  called subadars and jemadars. In each regiment the senior Indian officer
  is called ressaldar or subadar-major.</p>

  <p>The army in India, by which is meant all military forces in India, is
  administered by a commander-in-chief, who is a member of council. The
  head-quarter staff includes a military secretary, the chief of the
  general staff, an adjutant and a quartermaster-general, director-general
  of ordnance and military works, and a director of medical
  services.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: Hon. J.&nbsp;W.

  <p><b>Army Worm</b>, the very destructive larva of the moth
  <i>Helioph&#x12D;la</i> or <i>Leucania unipuncta</i>, so called from its
  habit of marching in compact bodies of enormous number, devouring almost
  every green thing it meets. It is about 1½ inches long, greenish in
  colour, with black stripes, and is found in various parts of the world,
  but is particularly destructive in North America. The larva of

  several members of which greatly distinguished themselves.&mdash;Antoine,
  an eminent French advocate, was born 1560, died 1619. Distinguished as a
  zealous defender of the cause of Henry IV, and for his powerful and
  successful defence of the University of Paris against the Jesuits in
  1594. His family formed the nucleus of the sect of the Jansenists (see
  <i>Jansenius</i>) in France.&mdash;His son Antoine, called the <i>Great
  Arnauld</i>, was born 6th Feb., 1612, at Paris, died 9th Aug., 1694, at
  Brussels. He devoted himself to theology, and was received in 1641 among
  the doctors of the Sorbonne. He engaged in all the quarrels of the French
  Jansenists with the Jesuits, the clergy, and the Government, was the
  chief Jansenist writer, and was considered their head. Excluded from <!--
  Page 256 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page256"></a>[256]</span>the
  Sorbonne, he retired to Port Royal, where he wrote, in conjunction with
  his friend Nicole, a celebrated system of logic (hence called the <i>Port
  Royal Logic</i>). On account of persecution he fled, in 1679, to the
  Netherlands. His works, which are mainly controversies with the Jesuits
  or the Calvinists, are very voluminous.&mdash;His brother Robert, born
  1588, died 1674, retired to Port Royal, where he wrote a translation of
  Josephus, and other works.&mdash;Robert's daughter Angélique, born 1624,
  died 1684, was eminent in the religious world, and was subjected to
  persecution on account of her unflinching adherence to Jansenism.</p>

  <p><b>Arndt</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>rnt), Ernst Moritz, German patriot and
  poet, was born 1769, died 1860. He was appointed professor of history at
  Greifswald in 1806, and stirred up the national feeling against Napoleon
  in his work <i>Geist der Zeit</i> (<i>Spirit of the Time)</i>. In 1812-3
  he zealously promoted the war of independence by a number of pamphlets,
  poems, and spirited songs, among which it is sufficient to refer to his
  <i>Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?</i>, <i>Der Gott, der Eisen wachsen
  liess</i>, and <i>Was blasen die Trompeten? Husaren, heraus!</i>, which
  were caught up and sung from one end of Germany to the other. In 1817 he
  married a sister of the theologian Schleiermacher, and settled at Bonn in
  order to undertake the duties of professor of history. He was, however,
  suspended till 1840 on account of his liberal opinions, when he was
  restored to his chair on the accession of Frederick William IV.</p>

  <p><b>Arndt</b>, Johann, celebrated German mystic theologian, born 1555,
  died 1621. His principal work, <i>Wahres Christenthum</i> (True
  Christianity), is still popular in Germany, and has been translated into
  almost all European languages. Another of his publications is
  <i>Paradiesgaertlein</i>, translated into English (The Garden of
  Paradise).</p>

  <p><b>Arne</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>rn), Thomas Augustine, English composer,
  born at London 1710, died 1778. His first opera, <i>Fair Rosamond</i>,
  was performed in 1733 at Lincoln's-Inn Fields, and was received with
  great applause. Then followed a version of Fielding's <i>Tom Thumb</i>,
  altered into <i>The Opera of Operas</i>, a musical burlesque. His style
  in the <i>Comus</i> (1738) is still more original and cultivated. To him
  we owe the national air <i>Rule, Britannia</i>, originally given in a
  popular piece called the <i>Masque of Alfred</i>. After having composed
  two oratorios and several operas he received the degree of Doctor of
  Music at Oxford. He composed, also, music for several of the songs in
  Shakespeare's dramas, and various pieces of instrumental music.</p>

  contains many interesting public buildings; manufactures cabinet wares,
  mirrors, carriages, mathematical instruments, &amp;c.; has paper-mills,
  and its trade is important. In 1795 it was stormed by the French, who
  were driven from it by the Prussians in 1813. Pop. 70,664 (1917).</p>

  <p><b>Arnhem Land</b>, a portion of the northern territory of S.

  <p><b>Ar´nica</b>, a genus of plants, nat. ord. Compositæ, containing
  eighteen species, one of which is found in Central Europe, <i>A.
  mont&#x101;na</i> (leopard's bane or mountain tobacco), but is not a
  native of Britain. It has a perennial root, a stem about 2 feet high,
  bearing on the summit flowers of a dark golden yellow. In every part of
  the plant there is an acrid resin and a volatile oil, and in the flowers
  an acrid bitter principle called <i>arnicin</i>. The root contains also a
  considerable quantity of tannin. A tincture of it is employed as an
  external application to wounds and bruises. It was introduced into
  English gardens about the middle of the eighteenth century.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´nim</b>, Elisabeth von, a German writer, also known as Bettina,
  wife of Louis Achim von Arnim, and sister of the poet Clemens Brentano;
  born at Frankfort in 1785, died at Berlin 1859. Even in her childhood she
  manifested an inclination towards eccentricities and poetical
  peculiarities of many kinds. She entered into correspondence with Goethe,
  for whom she entertained a violent passion, although he was then in his
  sixtieth year. In 1835 she published Goethe's <i>Briefwechsel mit einem
  Kinde</i> (Goethe's Correspondence with a Child), containing, among
  others, the letters that she alleged to have passed between her and
  Goethe. Her later writings dealt with subjects like the emancipation of
  the Jews, and the abolition of capital punishment. Her husband, Ludwig
  Achim von Arnim, born at Berlin in 1781, died 1831, distinguished himself
  as a writer of novels. In concert with her brother, Clemens Brentano, he
  published a collection of popular German songs and ballads entitled
  <i>Des Knaben Wunderhorn</i>.&mdash;Her daughter, <!-- Page 257 --><span

  miles below it, into the Tuscan Sea, after a course of 130 miles.</p>

  <p><b>Arno´bius</b>, an early Christian writer, was a teacher of rhetoric
  at Sicca Veneria, in Numidia, and in 303 became a Christian; he died
  about 326. He wrote seven books of <i>Disputationes adversus Gentes</i>
  (or <i>Adversus Nationes</i>), in which he refuted the objections of the
  heathens against Christianity. This work betrays a defective knowledge of
  Christianity, but is rich in materials for the understanding of Greek and
  Roman mythology.</p>

  <p><b>Arnold</b>, an urban district or town of England, Nottinghamshire,
  3 miles north-east of Nottingham, with lace and hosiery manufactures,
  &amp;c. It has a church built in the twelfth century, and a tower dating

  <p><b>Ar´nold</b>, Benedict, a general in the American army during the
  War of Independence, born in 1741. He rendered his name infamous by his
  attempt to betray the strong fortress of West Point, with all the arms
  and immense stores which were there deposited, into the hands of the
  British. The project failed through the capture of Major André, when
  Arnold made his escape to the British lines. He received a commission as
  brigadier-general in the British army, and took part in several marauding
  expeditions. He subsequently settled in the West Indies, and ultimately
  came to London, where he died in 1801.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´nold</b>, Sir Edwin, <span class="scac">K.C.I.E.</span>, poet,
  Sanskrit scholar, and journalist, born 1832. Educated at Oxford, where he
  took the Newdigate prize for a poem entitled the <i>Feast of
  Belshazzar</i> in 1852, he was successively second master in King Edward
  VI's College at Birmingham, and principal of the Sanskrit College at
  Poonah in Bombay. In 1861 he joined the editorial staff of the <i>Daily
  Telegraph</i>, with which he was henceforth connected. He died in 1904.
  He was author of <i>Poems, Narrative and Lyrical</i>; translations from
  the Greek and Sanskrit; <i>The Light of Asia</i>, a poem on the life and
  teaching of Buddha; <i>The Light of the World</i>; <i>Pearls of the
  Faith</i>; <i>Lotus and Jewel</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´nold</b>, Matthew, English critic, essayist, and poet, was born
  at Laleham, near Staines, 1822, being a son of Dr. Arnold of Rugby. He

  <p><b>Ar´nold</b>, Thomas, headmaster of Rugby School, and professor of
  modern history in the University of Oxford, born at Cowes, in the Isle of
  Wight, in 1795, died 1842. He entered Oxford in his sixteenth year, and
  in 1815 he was elected Fellow of Oriel College, and both in that year and
  1817 he obtained the chancellor's prize for Latin and English essays.
  After taking deacon's orders he settled at Laleham, near Staines, where
  he employed himself in preparing young men for the universities. In 1828
  he was appointed headmaster of Rugby School, and devoted himself to his
  new duties with the greatest ardour. While giving due prominence to the
  classics, he deprived them of their exclusiveness by introducing various
  other branches into his course, and he was particularly careful that the
  education which he furnished should be in the highest sense moral and
  Christian. His success was remarkable. Not only did Rugby School become
  crowded beyond any former precedent, but the superiority of Dr. Arnold's
  system became so generally recognized that it may be justly said to have
  done much for the general improvement of the public schools of England.
  In 1841 he was appointed professor of modern history at Oxford, and
  delivered his introductory course of lectures with great success. His
  chief works are his edition of Thucydides, his <i>History of Rome</i>
  (unhappily left unfinished), and his <i>Sermons</i>. There is an
  admirable memoir of him by A.&nbsp;P. Stanley, Dean of Westminster (London, 2
  vols., 1845).&mdash;Cf Lytton Strachey, <i>Eminent Victorians</i>.</p>

  as member of Parliament for West Belfast from 1892, for Croydon from
  1906, as a Liberal Unionist, was Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty
  from 1900 to 1903, then Secretary of State for War, a position which he
  held till Dec., 1905, having put forward sweeping proposals for the
  improvement of our army. He wrote on various subjects, especially books
  for popular instruction, including <i>How to Solve the Irish Land

  appointed a surgeon in the East India Company's naval service. In 1811 he
  commenced practice in London. In 1837 he was appointed extraordinary
  physician to the queen. In 1827 he published <i>Elements of Physics</i>,
  and in 1838 a treatise on <i>Warming and Ventilation</i>, &amp;c. He is
  widely known as the inventor of a stove which is regarded as one of the
  most economical arrangements for burning fuel, a ventilating
  chimney-valve, and his water-bed for the protection of the sick against
  bed-sores. In 1869 he gave £1000 to each of the four Scottish
  universities and £2000 to London University for the promotion of the
  study of physics. He was a strong advocate of a scientific as opposed to
  a purely classical education.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´ran</b>, an island of Scotland, in the Firth of Clyde, part of
  Bute county; length, north to south, 20 miles; breadth, about 10 miles;
  area, 165 sq. miles, or 105,814 acres, of which about 15,000 are under
  cultivation. It is of a wild and romantic appearance, particularly the
  northern half, where the island attains its loftiest summit in Goatfell,
  2866 feet high. The coast presents several indentations, of which that of
  Lamlash, forming a capacious bay, completely sheltered by Holy Island, is
  one of the best natural harbours in the west of Scotland. On the small
  island of Pladda, about a mile from the south shore, a lighthouse has
  been erected. The geology of Arran has attracted much attention, as
  furnishing within a comparatively narrow space distinct sections of the
  great geological formations; while the botany possesses almost equal
  interest, both in the variety and the rarity of many of its plants. Among
  objects of interest are relics of Danish forts, standing stones, cairns,
  &amp;c. Lamlash and Brodick are villages. The island is a favourite

  <p><b>Arrest´</b> is the apprehending or restraining of one's person,
  which, in civil cases, can take place legally only by process in
  execution of the command of some court or officers of justice; but in
  criminal cases any man may arrest without warrant or precept, and every
  person is liable to arrest without distinction, but no man is to be
  arrested unless charged with such a crime as will at least justify
  holding him to bail when taken. <i>Magna Charta</i> and the <i>Habeas
  Corpus Act</i> are the two great statutes for securing the liberty of the
  subject against unlawful arrests and suits.</p>

  <p><b>Arrest´ment</b>, in Scots law, a process by which a creditor may
  attach money or movable property which a third party holds for behoof of
  his debtor. In 1870 an Act was passed for Scotland which provides that
  only that part of the weekly wages of labourers, and of workpeople
  generally, which is in excess of 20<i>s</i>. is liable to arrestment for
  debt.</p>

  <p><b>Arrest of Judgment</b>, in law, the staying or stopping of a
  judgment after verdict, for causes assigned. Courts have power to arrest
  judgment for intrinsic causes appearing upon the face of the record; as
  when the declaration varies from the original writ; when the verdict
  differs materially from the pleadings; or when the case laid in the
  declaration is not sufficient in point of law to found an action
  upon.</p>

  born 19th Feb., 1859, at Wyk, near Upsala. He was educated at the
  Universities of Upsala (1876-81) and Stockholm (1881-4), spent two years
  in travelling, and after doing much original research was appointed
  professor of physics at the University of Stockholm. To him is due the
  establishment of the theory of electrolytic dissociation, supplying a
  reasonable explanation of many chemical phenomena otherwise insoluble. He
  subsequently extended the application of the electrolytic theory to the
  phenomena of atmospheric electricity. His dissertation <i>Sur la
  conductibilité galvanique des électrolytes</i> appeared in 1884. Among
  his other works is <i>Worlds in the Making</i> (English translation,

  was advanced to the senatorial and even consular dignities. His extant
  works are: <i>The Expedition of Alexander</i>, in seven books; a book
  <i>On the Affairs of India</i>; an <i>Epistle to Hadrian</i>; a
  <i>Treatise on Tactics</i>; a <i>Periplus of the Euxine Sea</i>; a

    Arrow-root (<i>Maranta arundin&#x101;c&#x115;a</i>)
  </div>

  <p><b>Arrow-root</b>, a starch largely used for food and for other
  purposes. Arrow-root proper is obtained from the rhizomes or rootstocks
  of several species of plants of the genus Maranta (nat. ord. Marantaceæ),
  and perhaps owes its name to the scales which cover the rhizome, which
  have some resemblance to the point of an arrow. Some, however, suppose
  that the name is due to the fact of the fresh roots being used as an
  application against wounds inflicted by poisoned arrows, and others say
  that <i>arrow</i> is a corruption of <i>ara</i>, the Indian name of the
  plant. The species from which arrow-root is most commonly obtained is
  <i>M. arundin&#x101;c&#x115;a</i>, hence called the <i>arrow-root
  plant</i>. Brazilian arrow-root, or tapioca meal, is got from the large
  fleshy root of <i>Manihot utilissima</i>, after the poisonous juice has
  been got rid of; East Indian arrow-root, from the large rootstocks of
  <i>Curc&#x16D;ma angustifolia</i>; Chinese arrow-root, from the creeping
  rhizomes of <i>Nelumbium speci&#x14D;sum</i>; English arrow-root, from
  the potato; Portland arrow-root, from the corms of <i>Arum
  macul&#x101;tum</i>; and Oswego arrow-root, from Indian corn. Analyses
  made in 1902 and 1906 show that the idea generally held of the nourishing
  qualities of arrow-root is a delusion, and that the proteids, which are
  true muscle-builders, are present in an extremely small extent.
  Arrow-root, however, mixed with eggs, milk, and flavourings, is largely
  used in the dietary of invalids.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´samas</b>, a manufacturing town in the Russian government of
  Nijni-Novgorod, on the Tesha, 250 miles east of Moscow, with a cathedral
  and large convent. Pop. 12,000.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´senal</b>, a royal or public magazine or place appointed for the
  making, repairing, keeping, and issuing of military stores. An arsenal of
  the first class should include factories for guns and gun-carriages,
  small-arms, small-arms ammunition, harness, saddlery, tents, and powder;
  a laboratory and large store-houses. In arsenals of the second class
  workshops take the place of the factories. The Royal Arsenal, Woolwich,
  which manufactures warlike implements and stores for the army and navy,
  was formed about 1720, and comprises factories, laboratories, &amp;c.,
  for the manufacture and final fitting up of almost every kind of arms and
  ammunition. Great quantities of military and naval stores are kept at the
  dockyards of Chatham, Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Pembroke. In France there
  are various arsenals or depots of war-material, which is manufactured at
  Mézières, Toulouse, Besançon, &amp;c.; the great naval arsenals are Brest
  and Toulon. Until 1919 the chief German arsenals were at Spandau,
  Strassburg, and Dantzig. The chief Austrian arsenal was the immense
  establishment at Vienna, which included gun-factory, laboratory,
  small-arms and carriage factories, &amp;c. Russia had her principal
  arsenal at Petrograd, with supplementary factories of arms and ammunition
  at Briansk, Kiev, and elsewhere. In Italy Turin is the centre of the
  military factories. There are a number of arsenals in the United States,
  but individually they are of little importance.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´senic</b> (symbol <b>As</b>, atomic weight 75), a common element
  usually found combined with metals as arsenides, the commonest of which
  is arsenical pyrites, FeAsS. It has a steel colour and high metallic
  lustre, and tarnishes on exposure to the air, first changing to yellow,
  and finally to black. In hardness it equals copper; it is extremely
  brittle, and very volatile, beginning to sublime before it melts. It
  burns with a blue flame, and emits a smell of garlic. Its specific
  gravity is 5.76. It forms compounds with most of the metals. Combined
  with sulphur it forms orpiment and realgar, which are the yellow and red
  sulphides of arsenic. Orpiment is the true <i>arsenicum</i> of the
  ancients. With oxygen arsenic forms two compounds, the more important of
  which is arsenious oxides or arsenic trioxide
  (As<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>), which is the <i>white arsenic</i>, or
  simply <i>arsenic</i> of the shops. It is usually seen in white, glassy,
  translucent masses, and is obtained by sublimation from several ores
  containing arsenic in combination with metals, particularly from
  arsenical pyrites. Of all substances arsenic is that which has most
  frequently occasioned death by poisoning, both by accident and design.
  The best remedies against the effects of arsenic on the stomach are
  ferric hydroxide or magnesic hydroxide, or a mixture of both, with
  copious draughts of bland liquids of a mucilaginous consistence, which
  serve to procure its complete ejection from the stomach. Oils and fats
  generally, milk, albumen, wheat-flour, oatmeal, sugar or syrup, have all
  proved useful in counteracting its effect. Like many other virulent
  poisons it is a safe and useful medicine, especially in skin diseases,
  when judiciously employed. It is used as a flux for glass, and also for
  forming pigments. The arsenite of copper (Scheele's green) and a double
  arsenite and acetate of copper (emerald green) were formerly largely used
  to colour paper-hangings for rooms; but as poisonous gases are liable to
  be given off, the practice has been to a great extent abandoned. Arsenic
  compounds have been used for colouring confectionery, and other articles,
  bright green, but their chief industrial use is in the preparation of
  insecticides. Arsenic is found in crude oil of vitriol, and occasionally
  in products such as grape-sugar, beer, &amp;c., in the manufacture of
  which oil of vitriol is employed. Plants die when placed in a solution of
  arsenic, but corn is often steeped in such a solution, previous to
  planting, for preventing smut, and the growth of the future plant is not
  injured thereby.</p>

  <p><b>Arshin</b> (a<span class="x1"><span

  length equal to 28 inches.</p>

  <p><b>Arsin´oë</b>, a city of ancient Egypt on Lake M&oelig;ris, said to
  have been founded about 2300 B.&nbsp;C., but renamed after Arsinoë, wife and
  sister of Ptolemy II of Egypt, and called also <i>Crocodilopolis</i>,
  from the sacred crocodiles kept at it.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´sis</b>, a term applied in prosody to that syllable in a measure
  where the emphasis is put; in elocution, the elevation of the voice, in
  distinction from <i>thesis</i>, or its depression. <i>Arsis</i> and
  <i>thesis</i>, in music, are the strong position and weak position of the
  bar, indicated by the down-beat and up-beat in marking time.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´son</b>, in English law, the malicious burning of a
  dwelling-house or outhouse of another man, which by the common law is
  felony, and which, if <!-- Page 262 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page262"></a>[262]</span>any person is therein, is capital. Also,
  the wilful setting fire to any church, chapel, warehouse, mill, barn,
  agricultural produce, ship, coal-mine, and the like. In Scotland it is
  called <i>wilful fire-raising</i>, and in both England and Scotland it is
  a considerable aggravation of the crime if the burning is to defraud
  insurers.</p>

  <p><b>Art</b>, in its most extended sense, as distinguished from nature
  on the one hand and from science on the other, has been defined as every
  regulated operation or dexterity by which organized beings pursue ends
  which they know beforehand, together with the rules and the result of
  every such operation or dexterity. Science consists in <i>knowing</i>,
  art in <i>doing</i>. In this wide sense it embraces what are usually
  called the useful arts. In a narrower and purely æsthetic sense it
  designates what are more specifically termed the fine arts, as
  architecture, sculpture, painting, music, and poetry. The useful arts
  have their origin in positive practical needs, and restrict themselves to
  satisfying them. The fine arts minister to the sentiment of taste through
  the medium of the beautiful in form, colour, rhythm, or harmony. See
  <i>Fine Arts</i>, <i>Painting</i>, <i>Sculpture</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;In the
  Middle Ages it was common to give certain branches of study the name of
  arts.&mdash;Cf. A.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;R. Carter, <i>History of Art<i>, </i>The Year's

  <p><b>Art</b>, Teaching of. With the advent of the present industrial age
  the teaching of art has undergone a profound change. The fine and the
  industrial arts have been equally affected. In mediæval times, and in the
  earlier classic ages, the system of apprenticeship prevailed, and all
  teaching of the arts and of the artistic crafts was given by masters of
  the various arts or trades to the apprentices who worked under their
  guidance as assistants. Standards of excellence were maintained by trade
  guilds, who enforced rules as to workmanship as well as rules for the
  economic conditions of each trade or craft. The painter of pictures, or
  of mural decorations, was trained in the same way as any other craftsman,
  working as an apprentice under a master.</p>

  <p>When, in the last century, machinery driven by steam-power took the
  place of hand labour in industry, the small independent workshops
  gradually disappeared, as the industrial centres increased in those
  localities where coal or raw material was most easily obtained; and, as
  the processes of each trade or craft became more and more subdivided and
  specialized, the old system of apprenticeship, which had become
  unnecessary, broke down. The teaching and tradition of the small
  independent craft workshops had no counterpart in the new centralized
  industrial systems. Even the painters of pictures needed no longer to
  prepare their own materials, for special industries arose, and mechanical
  processes were developed, for the work which formerly had been done in
  the artists' workshops by apprentices. The fine arts in this way suffered
  the loss of their old systems of teaching and instruction.</p>

  <p>To meet the need for a revival of art teaching in the crafts and other
  industries, there arose a movement towards the centralization of teaching
  in schools of art during the latter half of the nineteenth century.
  Following the impulse given to that movement by the great exhibition in
  1850, the British Government founded the schools of science and art in
  London and in most of the important provincial towns. Earlier in the
  century bodies of artists had founded national academies for the teaching
  of art; and the teaching of drawing was gradually adopted as a part of
  ordinary school education. Step by step training in schools of art or
  technical schools took the place of the teaching formerly given during
  apprenticeship in every craft workshop. The ancient guilds were replaced
  by the new trades unions, but these took no part in the maintenance of
  artistic standards nor of quality in workmanship.</p>

  <p>At the present time the teaching of art begins with the early school
  lessons in drawing, and is carried on in special technical classes or
  schools of art, where teachers of the 'fine arts' and of the artistic
  crafts give instruction to students preparing for professional work. In a
  few of the artistic trades the system of apprenticeship still survives,
  but the teaching given by that means is usually supplemented by
  attendance at a school of art or technical school. Under the Education
  Act of 1918 attendance at technical classes in the daytime became
  compulsory for apprentices in all industrial trades.</p>

  <p>The subject of art teaching was formerly disregarded by the
  universities, but has become definitely within their province since the
  founding of the Slade professorships at Oxford, Cambridge, and London
  Universities, and of the professorship of fine art at the University of
  Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>The chief schools of art in Great Britain are the schools of the Royal
  Academy in London, the Slade School at University College, London, and
  the Royal College of Art at South Kensington, also the Central School of
  Arts and Crafts, and the other large metropolitan schools of the London
  County Council.</p>

  <p>In most of the English provincial towns are municipal or other schools
  of art under the control of the Board of Education.</p>

  <p>In Scotland the chief schools are the four central
  institutions&mdash;the Edinburgh College of Art, and the schools of art
  of Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Dundee. In each of these a diploma is given on
  the satisfactory completion of a prescribed course of study. <!-- Page
  263 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page263"></a>[263]</span></p>

  <p>In Ireland the chief schools are those of the Royal Hibernian Academy
  in Dublin, and the provincial schools of art under the Department of
  Agriculture and Technology.</p>

  <p>On the Continent the chief centre of artistic training has for many
  years been in Paris. Advanced students from most European and American
  art schools spend some of the later period of their study in the schools
  of Paris, in painting, in sculpture, or in architecture. There is,
  naturally, a valuable incentive and stimulation due to this gathering
  together of advanced students from all countries, as well as to the high
  academic tradition and sense of style of the French.</p>

  <p>The 'atelier' system, which is followed in the French schools, is
  simple and personal. The expenses of an 'atelier', or studio, are borne
  by a group of students by the consent and under the guidance of an artist
  of reputation, who visits the 'atelier' at stated intervals, but is not
  concerned in its administration. In this way the relations between the
  professor and his pupils are extremely direct and personal. Most of the
  distinguished artists of Paris are attached to some 'atelier' to which
  chosen pupils are admitted.</p>

  <p>There are also in Paris excellent schools for training in the applied
  arts, schools for furniture-making, printing, jewellery, and other
  artistic trades. These are on private foundations, but also receive State
  aid.</p>

  <p>The teaching of art that is given at the present day as a part of
  ordinary general education attempts little more than a training in the
  elements of drawing, with some practice in the use of colour. The purpose
  of the drawing lesson is the attainment of skill in the representation of
  objects rather than the training of the æsthetic sense, or of artistic
  judgment or taste.</p>

  <p>In the schools of art opportunities are provided for training in
  drawing and painting, sculpture, and architecture, and in the general
  principles of design in these arts, and in many of the artistic crafts
  and industrial processes. In some localities, where particular industries
  or artistic trades are concentrated, special schools for artistic and
  technical training are provided. The present tendency is towards the
  development of special schools for particular artistic trades or
  professions.</p>

  <p>A complete system of training in any art must of necessity include:
  (1) actual technical practice; (2) teaching of the canons of workmanship
  of the art; (3) acquaintance with its historical development, especially
  with the notable examples and the highest achievements of past masters in
  the art.</p>

  associations were known in ancient Russia as <i>drushina</i> or
  <i>wataga</i>. The artels originally consisted of bodies of men
  associating for the purpose of jointly undertaking a piece of work and
  dividing the profits. Artels were formed in the thirteenth and fourteenth
  centuries for the co-operation of their members in hunting and fishing.
  Inspired and stimulated by the Schulze-Delitzsch associations established
  in Germany, the Russian artels have extended their activity to various
  branches of industrial life. There are now consum artels, credit artels,
  and insurance artels, but the most important are the artisan and
  industrial artels. Some of the artels, however, are little more than
  trade guilds with mutual responsibility.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´t&#x115;mis</b>, an ancient Greek divinity, identified with the
  Roman Diana. She was the daughter of Zeus (Jupiter) and Leto or Latona,
  and was the twin sister of Apollo, born in the Island of Delos. She is
  variously represented as a huntress, with bow and arrows; as a goddess of
  the nymphs, in a chariot drawn by four stags; and as the moon-goddess,
  with the crescent of the moon above her forehead. She was a maiden
  divinity, never conquered by love, except when Endymion made her feel its
  power. She demanded the strictest chastity from her worshippers, and she
  is represented as having changed <!-- Page 264 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page264"></a>[264]</span>Actæon into a stag, and
  caused him to be torn in pieces by his own dogs, because he had secretly
  watched her as she was bathing. The Artemisia was a festival celebrated
  in her honour at Delphi. The famous temple of Artemis at Ephesus was
  considered one of the wonders of the world, but the goddess worshipped
  there was very different from the huntress goddess of Greece, being of
  Eastern origin, and regarded as the symbol of fruitful nature.</p>

  <p><b>Artemi´sia</b>, Queen of Caria, in Asia Minor, about 352-350 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, sister and wife of Maus&#x14D;lus, to whom she
  erected in her capital, Halicarnassus, a monument, called the
  Mausol&#x113;um, which was reckoned among the seven wonders of the
  world.</p>

  <p><b>Artemi´sia</b>, a genus of plants of numerous species, nat. ord.
  Compositæ, comprising mugwort, southernwood, and wormwood. Certain alpine
  species are the flavouring ingredient in absinthe. See
  <i>Wormwood</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Artemi´sium</b>, a promontory in Eub&oelig;a, an island of the
  Ægean, near which several naval battles between the Greeks and Persians
  were fought, 480 <span class="scac">B.C.</span></p>

  <p><b>Ar´temus Ward</b>. See <i>Browne, Charles Farrar</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´teries</b>, the system of cylindrical vessels or tubes,
  membranous, elastic, and pulsatile, which convey the blood from the heart
  to all parts of the body, by ramifications which, as they proceed,
  diminish in size and increase in number, and terminate in minute
  capillaries uniting the ends of the arteries with the beginnings of the
  veins. There are two principal arteries or arterial trunks: the
  <i>aorta</i>, which rises from the left ventricle of the heart and
  ramifies through the whole body, sending off great branches to the head,
  neck, and upper limbs, and downwards to the lower limbs, &amp;c.; and the
  <i>pulmonary artery</i>, which conveys venous blood from the right
  ventricle to the lungs, to be purified in the process of respiration.</p>

  <p><b>Arteriot´omy</b>, the opening or cutting of an artery for the
  purpose of blood-letting, as, for instance, to relieve pressure of the
  brain in apoplexy.</p>

  <p><b>Arte´sian Wells</b>, so called from the French province of Artois,
  where they appear to have been first used on an extensive scale, are
  perpendicular borings into the ground through which water rises to the
  surface of the soil, producing a constant flow or stream, the ultimate
  sources of supply being higher than the mouth of the boring, and the
  water thus rising by the well-known law. They are generally sunk in
  valley plains and districts where the lower pervious strata are bent into
  basin-shaped curves. The rain falling on the outcrops of these saturates
  the whole porous bed, so that when the bore reaches it the water by
  hydraulic pressure rushes up towards the level of the highest portion of
  the strata. The supply is sometimes so abundant as to be used extensively
  as a moving power, and in arid regions for fertilizing the ground, to
  which purpose artesian springs have been applied from a very remote
  period. Thus many artesian wells have been sunk in the Algerian Sahara,
  which have proved an immense boon to the district. The water of most of
  these is potable, but a few are a little saline, though not to such an
  extent as to influence vegetation. The hollows in which London and Paris
  lie are both perforated in many places by borings of this nature. At
  London they were first sunk only to the sand, but afterwards into the
  chalk. One of the most celebrated artesian wells is that of Grenelle,
  near Paris, 1798 feet deep, completed in 1841, after eight years' work.
  Artesian wells are now common in many countries, and have been sunk to
  the depth of a mile or more. As the temperature of water from great
  depths is invariably higher than that at the surface, artesian wells have
  been made to supply warm water for heating manufactories, greenhouses,
  hospitals, fish-ponds, &amp;c. They have also been made in the United
  States and Australia for the purpose of irrigation. Petroleum wells are
  generally of the same technical description. Artesian wells are now made
  with larger diameters than formerly, and altogether their construction
  has been rendered much more easy in modern times. See <i>Boring</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Arteveld</b>, or <b>Artevelde</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>r´te-velt, a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>r´te-vel-de), the name of two men
  distinguished in the history of the Low Countries.&mdash;1. Jacob van, a
  brewer of Ghent, born about 1300, was selected by his fellow-townsmen to
  lead them in their struggles against Count Louis of Flanders. In 1338 he
  was appointed captain of the forces of Ghent, and for several years
  exercised a sort of sovereign power. A proposal to make the Black Prince,
  son of Edward III of England, Governor of Flanders led to an insurrection
  in which Arteveld lost his life (1345).&mdash;2. Philip, son of the
  former, at the head of the forces of Ghent gained a great victory over
  the Count of Flanders, Louis II, and for a time assumed the state of a
  sovereign prince. His reign proved short-lived. The Count <!-- Page 265
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page265"></a>[265]</span>of Flanders
  returned with a large French force, fully disciplined and skilfully
  commanded. Arteveld was rash enough to meet them in the open field at
  Roosebeke, between Courtrai and Ghent, in 1382, and fell with 25,000
  Flemings.</p>

  <p><b>Arthri´tis</b> (Gr. <i>arthron</i>, a joint), any inflammatory
  distemper that affects the joints, particularly chronic rheumatism or
  gout.</p>

  <p><b>Arthro´dia</b>, a species of articulation, in which the head of one
  bone is received into a shallow socket in another; a ball-and-socket
  joint.</p>

  <p><b>Arthrop´oda</b>, one of the two primary divisions (Anarthropoda
  being the other) into which modern naturalists have divided the
  sub-kingdom Annulosa, having the body composed of a series of segments,
  some always being provided with articulated appendages. The division
  comprises Crustaceans, Spiders, Scorpions, Centipedes, and Insects.</p>

  <p><b>Arthrozo´a</b>, a name sometimes given to all articulated animals,
  including the arthropoda and worms.</p>

  <p><b>Arthur</b>, Chester Alan, twenty-first President of the United
  States, born 1830, died 1886, was the son of Scottish parents, his father
  being pastor of Baptist churches in Vermont and New York. He chose law as
  a profession, and practised in New York. As a politician he became a
  leader in the Republican party. During the civil war he was energetic as
  quarter-master-general of New York in getting troops raised and equipped.
  He was afterwards collector of customs for the port of New York. In 1880
  he was elected Vice-President, succeeding as President on the death of
  Garfield in 1881.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´thur, King</b>, an ancient British hero of the sixth century,
  son of Uther Pendragon and the Princess Igerna, wife of Gorlois, Duke of
  Cornwall. He married Guinevere, or Ginevra; established the famous order
  of the Round Table; and reigned, surrounded by a splendid Court, twelve
  years in peace. After this, as the poets relate, he conquered Denmark,
  Norway, and France, slew the giants of Spain, and went to Rome. From
  thence he is said to have hastened home on account of the faithlessness
  of his wife, and Modred, his nephew, who had stirred up his subjects to
  rebellion. He subdued the rebels, but died in consequence of his wounds,
  on the Island of Avalon. The story of Arthur is supposed to have some
  foundation in fact, and has ever been a favourite subject with our
  romanticists and our poets. It is generally believed that Arthur was one
  of the last great Celtic chiefs who led his countrymen from the west of
  England to resist the settlement of the Saxons in the country. But many
  authorities regard him as a leader of the Cymry of Cumbria and
  Strath-Clyde against the Saxon invaders of the east coast and the Picts
  and Scots north of the Forth and the Clyde. See <i>Grail</i>,

  <p><b>Arthur's Seat</b>, a picturesque hill within the King's Park in the
  immediate vicinity of Edinburgh; has an altitude of 822 feet; descends
  rollingly to the <span class="scac">N.</span> and <span
  class="scac">E.</span> over a base each way of about five furlongs;
  presents an abrupt shoulder to the <span class="scac">S.</span>, and
  breaks down precipitously to the <span class="scac">W.</span> It is
  composed of a diversity of eruptive rocks, with some interposed and
  up-tilted sedimentary ones; and derives its name somehow from the
  legendary King Arthur.</p>

  <p><b>Ar´tiad</b> (Gr. <i>artios</i>, even-numbered), in chemistry, a
  name given to an element of even equivalency, as a dyad, tetrad, &amp;c.:
  opposed to a perissad, an element of uneven equivalency, such as a monad,
  triad, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Artichoke</b> (<i>Cyn&#x103;ra Scol&#x45E;mus</i>), sometimes
  called 'the Globe Artichoke', a well-known plant of the nat. ord.
  Compositæ, somewhat resembling a thistle, with large divided prickly
  leaves. The erect flower-stem terminates in a large round head of
  numerous imbricated oval spiny scales which surround the flowers. The
  fleshy bases of the scales with the large receptacle are the parts that
  are eaten. Artichokes were introduced into England early in the sixteenth
  century. The Jerusalem artichoke (a corruption of the It.
  <i>girasole</i>, a sunflower), or <i>Helianthus tuber&#x14D;sus</i>, is a
  species of sunflower, whose roots are used like potatoes; it was
  introduced into England in the early part of the seventeenth century.</p>

  <p><b>Article</b>, in grammar, a part of speech used before nouns to
  limit or define their application. In English <i>a</i> or <i>an</i> is
  usually called the indefinite article (the latter form being used before
  a vowel sound), and <i>the</i>, the definite article, but they are also
  described as adjectives. <i>An</i> was originally the same as <i>one</i>,
  and <i>the</i> as <i>that</i>. In Latin there were no articles, and Greek
  has only the definite article.</p>

  <p><b>Articles, Lords of the</b>, in Scottish history, a committee chosen
  equally from each estate or division of Parliament to prepare the various
  measures, which, when completed, were laid before the Parliament for
  adoption or rejection. They were first appointed in 1369, and gradually
  became a recognized part of the Scottish legislative machinery. Abolished
  1690.</p>

  <p><b>Articles, The Six</b>, in English ecclesiastical history, articles
  imposed by a statute (often called the Bloody Statute) passed in 1541,
  the thirty-third year of the reign of Henry VIII. They decreed the
  acknowledgment of transubstantiation, the sufficiency of communion in one
  kind, the obligation of vows of chastity, the propriety of private
  masses, celibacy of the clergy, <!-- Page 266 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page266"></a>[266]</span>and auricular confession. Acceptance of
  these doctrines was made obligatory on all persons under the severest
  penalties; the Act, however, was relaxed in 1544, and repealed in
  1549.</p>

  <p><b>Articles, The Thirty-nine</b>, of the Church of England, a
  statement of the particular points of doctrine, thirty-nine in number,
  maintained by the English Church; first promulgated by a convocation held
  in London in 1562-3, and confirmed by royal authority; founded on and
  superseding an older code issued in the reign of Edward VI. The first
  five articles contain a profession of faith in the Trinity; the
  incarnation of Jesus Christ, His descent to hell, and His resurrection;
  the divinity of the Holy Ghost. The three following relate to the canon
  of the Scripture. The eighth article declares a belief in the Apostles',
  Nicene, and Athanasian creeds. The ninth and following articles contain
  the doctrine of original sin, of justification by faith alone, of
  predestination, &amp;c. The nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first
  declare the Church to be the assembly of the faithful; that it can decide
  nothing except by the Scriptures. The twenty-second rejects the doctrine
  of purgatory, indulgences, the adoration of images, and the invocation of
  saints. The twenty-third decides that only those lawfully called shall
  preach or administer the sacraments. The twenty-fourth requires the
  liturgy to be in English. The twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth declare the
  sacraments effectual signs of grace (though administered by evil men), by
  which God excites and confirms our faith. They are two: baptism and the
  Lord's supper. Baptism, according to the twenty-seventh article, is a
  sign of regeneration, the seal of our adoption, by which faith is
  confirmed and grace increased. In the Lord's supper, according to article
  twenty-eight, the bread is the communion of the body of Christ, the wine
  the communion of his blood, but only through faith (article
  twenty-ninth); and the communion must be administered in both kinds
  (article thirty). The twenty-eighth article condemns the doctrine of
  transubstantiation, and the elevation and adoration of the host; the
  thirty-first rejects the sacrifice of the mass as blasphemous; the
  thirty-second permits the marriage of the clergy; the thirty-third
  maintains the efficacy of excommunication. The remaining articles relate
  to the supremacy of the king, the condemnation of Anabaptists, &amp;c.
  They were ratified anew in 1604 and 1628. All candidates for ordination
  must subscribe these articles, but they are not binding upon laymen,
  except judges and certain university officials. This formulary is now
  accepted by the Episcopalian Churches of Scotland, Ireland, and
  America.</p>

  <p><b>Articles of Association</b> are the rules framed by a company for
  the administration of its affairs. Public companies usually have separate
  articles of their own, but this is not essential. When a registered
  company has no articles, its business procedure is regulated by the
  statutory form, found in Schedule 1 of the Companies (Consolidation) Act,
  1908, and known as Table A. When separate articles are used they must be
  printed, signed, stamped, and filed along with the memorandum of
  association. Unlike the memorandum, the articles may be altered at any
  time, by special resolution, provided the alteration is within the powers
  given by the memorandum. Thus, where preferred shares are created by the
  memorandum, their privileges are more secure than if merely issued under
  the articles. The articles are intended merely for internal
  administration, and, while binding in questions between the company and
  its members as such, they do not affect third parties, unless the company
  has acted <i>ultra vires</i> and this was discoverable from the articles,
  which the public can inspect at a nominal fee.&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Articula´ta</b>, the third great section of the animal kingdom
  according to the arrangement of Cuvier, applied to invertebrates such as
  insects and worms, in which the body displays a jointed structure. The
  name is now obsolete. See <i>Arthropoda</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Articula´tion</b>, in anatomy a joint; the joining or juncture of
  the bones. This is of three kinds: (1) <i>Diarthr&#x14D;sis</i>, or a
  movable connection, such as the ball-and-socket joint; (2)
  <i>Synarthr&#x14D;sis</i>, immovable connection, as by suture, or
  junction by serrated margins; (3) <i>Symphysis</i>, or union by means of
  another substance, by a cartilage, tendon, or ligament.</p>

  <p><b>Artificial Limbs.</b> Artificial limbs of a primitive kind have
  been in use from very early times; but, as the material of which they
  were made was perishable, few specimens have been preserved. In the
  museum of the Royal College of Surgeons in London there is a good
  specimen of a Roman artificial leg which is believed to date back to the
  third century <span class="scac">B.C.</span> This leg is made of wood,
  covered with thin bronze; it has an iron sole-plate, and was fastened on
  by means of a waist-belt.</p>

  <p>In Irish legend we are told of Nuada, who led the tribe of the Dananns
  back to Ireland, having an artificial hand made of silver; from this he
  received the name of Argetlam or Silver-handed. In mediæval times Goetz
  von Berlichingen, who lost his right hand at the siege of Landshut
  (1505), had a hand made of iron to supply its place.</p>

  <p>Great improvements have been made in the manufacture of artificial
  limbs during the last <!-- Page 267 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page267"></a>[267]</span>fifty years. After the Franco-Prussian war
  the French Government adopted an artificial arm and hand known as the
  'Beaufort' and issued it to the soldiers who required it. This hand had a
  movable thumb controlled by a cord passing up the arm and fastened to a
  loop band over the opposite shoulder. An Englishman named Heather Bigg
  invented a hand with a movable thumb which was worked by a piston and
  controlled by a rubber ball fastened under the arm-pit. These designs
  have been improved upon from time to time, and an artificial hand can now
  be made which is capable of opening and closing at will, and of lifting
  and holding light articles.</p>

  <p>Artificial legs vary in design, from the simple pin leg to ingenious
  contrivances such as the 'Anglesey' leg, which is made of seasoned willow
  wood with steel ankles and knee-joints. This 'Anglesey' leg is the
  standard best-quality limb in Great Britain. The German artificial-limb
  makers use leather instead of wood. These leather legs fit comfortably,
  but are too heavy, as they have to be supported by steel bands.</p>

  <p><b>Artillery</b>, all ordnance such as guns and howitzers as opposed
  to small arms and machine-guns. The term is also used for the troops who
  serve these arms.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, artillery is divided into field, heavy, and siege
  artillery. For details of organization see <i>Army</i>. The earliest form
  of artillery was a metal tube which was placed in a convenient position
  on the ground. The charge of gunpowder was ignited by placing a match to
  a hole bored at the closed end, and the resulting explosion forced the
  projectile&mdash;a stone&mdash;more or less in the required direction.
  Later on this primitive weapon was provided with wheels. In another form
  one man fired it while a second man supported it on his shoulder. In the
  later Middle Ages guns of various calibres were known by the names of
  birds of prey or reptiles; among such were falcons and falconets,
  culverins and demi-culverins. The fourteenth century saw the development
  of artillery for siege purposes&mdash;chiefly by the Germans&mdash;and in
  the next century it began to be employed in open warfare; while in 1537
  the present Honourable Artillery Company was formed in London to
  encourage the use of all 'weapons of volley'. These weapons of volley
  were not even confined to fire-arms, but included bows and cross-bows.
  The earliest English troops raised as artillery personel were called the
  Regiment of Firelocks. Of late years artillery science has made almost
  inconceivable progress, thanks to which, <i>inter alia</i>, it is no
  longer necessary for the target to be visible from the gun-position. This
  fact, combined with the use of smokeless powder, makes the locating of
  hostile batteries exceedingly difficult. All field artillery, by which is
  meant guns and howitzers, which accompany mobile troops are designed on
  the quick-firing principle, by which the inevitable recoil at the moment
  of firing is absorbed by an arrangement known as the recoil-carriage,
  thus preventing any movement of the gun-carriage proper, and avoiding
  unnecessary labour for the gun-detachments, while at the same time
  allowing the men composing it to remain under cover of the shield with
  which the guns are provided. With the quick-firing gun, propellent and
  projectile are combined in one cartridge similar to that in use with
  small arms; with the howitzer they are separated. This difference is due
  to the fact that whereas guns are designed for a flat trajectory with a
  deep zone of fire-effect, howitzers are intended for high-angle fire with
  an almost vertical fall of shrapnel-bullets. This effect is produced by
  varying the charge for different ranges. A field battery consists of 6
  guns or howitzers and 12 ammunition-wagons. Both guns and wagons are of
  the limbered type, i.e. in two detachable parts, and the weight behind
  the team of an English gun is approximately 2 tons.</p>

  <p>As to tactical principles, it is recognized that the function of
  artillery is to assist the other arms, that it cannot by itself win a
  battle, and that its true <i>métier</i> is to prepare the way for and
  assist the infantry. During 1914-18 some 700,000 officers and men served
  with the Royal Regiment.</p>

  <p><b>Artillery Company, The Honourable</b>, the oldest existing body of
  volunteers in Great Britain, instituted in 1537, revived in 1610. It
  comprises six companies of infantry, besides artillery, and furnishes a
  guard of honour to the sovereign when visiting the city of London.
  Previous to 1842 the Company elected their own officers, but since that
  date they have been appointed by the Crown.</p>

  <p><b>Artillery Schools</b>, institutions established for the purpose of
  giving a special training to the officers, and in some cases the men,
  belonging to the artillery service. In Great Britain the artillery
  schools are at Woolwich and Shoeburyness. The Department of Artillery
  studies at Woolwich give artillery officers the means of continuing their
  studies after they have completed the usual course at the Royal Military
  College, and of qualifying for appointments requiring exceptional
  scientific attainments. The School of Gunnery at Shoeburyness gives
  instruction in gunnery to officers and men, and conducts all experiments
  connected with artillery and stores. The sands at the mouth of the Thames
  afford ample opportunity for artillery practice and firing at long
  ranges. The Royal Artillery Institution at Woolwich contains a museum,
  lecture-room, and printing-press, from which professional and scientific
  papers are periodically issued. <!-- Page 268 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p><b>Artiodac´tyla</b> (Gr. <i>artios</i>, even numbered,
  <i>dakt&#x45E;los</i>, a finger or toe), a section of the Ungulata or
  hoofed mammals, comprising all those in which the number of the toes is
  even (two or four), including the ruminants, such as the ox, sheep, deer,
  &amp;c., and also a number of non-ruminating animals, as the hippopotamus
  and the pig.</p>

  <p><b>Artisans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act</b>, an English Act of
  Parliament passed in 1868 to empower town councils and other local
  authorities to demolish or improve dwellings unfit for human habitation,
  and to build and maintain better dwellings in lieu thereof. Other Acts
  for the same object were passed in 1875, 1879, and 1882. See
  <i>Housing</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Artocarpa´ceæ</b>, a nat. ord. of plants, the bread-fruit order, by
  some botanists ranked as a sub-order of the Urticaceæ or nettles. They
  are trees or shrubs, with a milky juice, which in some species hardens
  into caoutchouc, and in the cow-tree (<i>Bros&#x12D;mum
  Galactodendron</i>) is a milk as good as that obtained from the cow. Many
  of the plants produce an edible fruit, of which the best known is the
  bread-fruit (Artocarpus).</p>

  <p><b>Artois</b> (a<span class="x1"><span

  anciently one of the seventeen provinces of the Netherlands, now almost
  completely included in the department of Pas-de-Calais.</p>

  <p><b>Artois, The Battle of.</b> See <i>European War</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Arts</b>, the name given to certain branches of study in the Middle
  Ages, originally called the 'liberal arts' to distinguish them from the
  'servile arts' or mechanical occupations. These arts were usually given
  as grammar, dialectics, rhetoric, music, arithmetic, geometry, and
  astronomy. Hence originated the terms 'art classes', 'degrees in arts',
  'Master of Arts', &amp;c., still in common use in universities, the
  faculty of arts being distinguished from those of divinity, law,
  medicine, or science. See <i>University</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Artsybashev</b>, Mikhail, Russian author, born in 1878. After a
  number of short stories he wrote, at the age of twenty-five, a novel
  entitled <i>Sanin</i>, published in 1907, which placed him at once among
  the most famous contemporary Russian authors. Whatever opinion literary
  critics may hold of this novel, his wonderful realism, simplicity of
  style, and psychological analysis cannot be disputed.</p>

  <p><b>Art Unions</b>, associations for encouraging art, an object which
  they mainly pursue by disposing of pictures, sculptures, &amp;c., by
  lottery among subscribers. They seem to have originated in France during
  the time of Napoleon I. They soon afterwards took root in Germany, where
  they have been very successful. The first art union established in
  Britain was that at Edinburgh in 1834. Art unions were legalized by the
  Art Unions Act, 1846 See <i>Lottery</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Ascet´icism</b> and <b>Ascet´ics</b> (from the Gr.
  <i>ask&#x113;sis</i>, meaning practice, bodily exercise, or athletic
  training). The early Christians, who devoted themselves to severe
  exercises of piety and strove to distinguish themselves from the world by
  abstinence from sensual enjoyments and by voluntary penances, adopted the
  name to signify the practice of spiritual things. Ascetics and asceticism
  have played an important part in the Christian Church, but the principle
  of striving after a higher and more spiritual life by subduing the animal
  appetites and passions has no necessary connection with Christianity.
  Thus there were ascetics among the Jews previous to Christ, and
  asceticism was inculcated by the Stoics, while in its most extreme form
  it may still be seen among the Brahmans and Buddhists. Monasticism was
  but one phase of asceticism. It must also be borne in mind that in the
  history of asceticism, pagan, Christian, Jewish, and Mohammedan, we are
  often dealing not only with religious but distinctly abnormal
  temperaments. See <i>Monasticism</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Ascid´ia</b> (Gr. <i>askos</i>, a wine-skin), the name given to the
  'Sea-squirts' or main section of the Tunicata, a class of animals of low
  grade, resembling a double-necked bottle, of a leathery or gristly
  nature, found at low-water mark on the sea-beach, and dredged from deep
  water attached to stones, shells, and fixed objects. One of the prominent
  openings admits the food and the water required in respiration, the other
  is the excretory aperture. A single <i>ganglion</i> represents the
  nervous system, placed between the two apertures. Male and female
  reproductive organs exist in each ascidian. They pass through peculiar
  phases of development, the young ascidian appearing like a tadpole-body.
  They may be <i>single</i> or <i>simple</i>, <i>social</i> or
  <i>compound</i>. In <i>social ascidians</i> the peduncles of a number of
  individuals are united into a common tubular stem, with a partial common
  circulation of blood. In these animals evolutionists see a link between

  <p><b>Asclepliada´ceæ,</b> an order of gamopetalous Dicotyledons, the
  distinguishing characteristic of which is that the anthers adhere to the
  five stigmatic processes, the whole sexual apparatus forming a single
  mass. The pollination arrangements are peculiar, recalling those of
  orchids. The members of this order are shrubs, or sometimes herbaceous
  plants, occasionally climbing, almost always with a milky juice. Many of
  them are employed as purgatives, diaphoretics, tonics, and febrifuges,
  and others as articles of food. Asclepias is the typical genus. See

  of exciting general perspiration without increasing in any sensible
  degree the heat of the body; <i>A. curassavica</i> is emetic, and its
  roots are frequently sent to England as ipecacuanha; the roots of <i>A.

  the penalty imposed for Adam's sin and Christ having satisfied the law.
  Having crossed over to Ireland, he was beginning to get into a good
  practice, and was elected to the Irish House of Commons, when his
  pamphlet was ordered to be burned by the public hangman, and he himself
  was expelled the House. His whole subsequent life was passed in pecuniary

  <p><b>Ash</b> (<i>Frax&#x12D;nus</i>), a genus of deciduous trees
  belonging to the nat. ord. Oleaceæ, having imperfect flowers and a
  seed-vessel prolonged into a thin wing at the apex (called a
  <i>samara</i>). There are a good many species, chiefly indigenous to
  North America. The common ash (<i>F. excelsior</i>), the only species
  indigenous to Central and Northern Europe, has a smooth bark, and grows
  tall and rather slender. The branches are flattened; the leaves have five
  pairs of pinnæ, terminated by an odd one, dark-green in colour;
  lanceolate, with serrated edges. The flowers are produced in loose spikes
  from the sides of the branches, and are succeeded by flat seeds which
  ripen in autumn. It is one of the most useful of British trees on account
  of the excellence of its hard tough wood and the rapidity of its growth,
  but often suffers greatly from a canker caused by the fungus <i>Nectria
  ditissima</i>. There are many varieties of it, as the weeping-ash, the
  curled-leaved ash, the entire-leaved ash, &amp;c. The flowering or manna
  ash (<i>F. Ornus</i>), by some placed in a distinct genus (Ornus), is a
  native of the south of Europe and Palestine. It yields the substance
  called manna, which is obtained by making incisions in the bark, when the
  juice exudes and hardens. Among American species are the white ash (<i>F.
  americana</i>), with lighter bark and leaves; the red or black ash (<i>F.
  pubescens</i>), with a brown bark; the black ash (<i>F.
  sambucifolia</i>), the blue ash, the green ash, &amp;c. They are all
  valuable trees. The mountain-ash or rowan belongs to a different
  order.</p>

  <p><b>Ashanti´</b>, a British territory in West Africa belonging to the
  Gold Coast Colony, of which it forms a large inland portion, under a
  chief commissioner; area about 20,000 sq. miles. It is in great part
  hilly, well-watered, and covered with dense tropical vegetation, and rich
  forests with excellent timber trees. The country round the towns,
  however, is carefully cultivated. The crops are chiefly rice, maize,
  millet, sugar-cane, <!-- Page 273 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page273"></a>[273]</span>cocoa, and yams, the last forming the
  staple vegetable food of the natives. Rubber is also a product. The
  domestic animals are cows, horses of small size, goats, and a species of
  hairy sheep. The wild animals include the elephant, rhinoceros, buffalo,
  lion, hippopotamus, &amp;c. Birds are numerous, and crocodiles and other
  reptiles abound. Gold is abundant, and mining concessions are now
  successfully worked. The Ashantis make excellent cotton and silk cloths,
  articles in gold and other metals, earthenware, leather, &amp;c. Ashanti
  used to form a kingdom ruled despotically, human sacrifices being very
  common. It is now under British administration, and attention is given to
  education, sanitation, agriculture, means of communication, &amp;c. There
  are Government schools at Coomassie and Sunyani and a number of
  missionary schools. The chief town is Coomassie (or Kumassi), now reached
  by a railway from the coast (length 168 miles); its population is 24,000.
  The British first came in contact with the Ashantis in 1807, and
  hostilities continued off and on till 1826, when they were driven from
  the sea-coast. Immediately after the transfer of the Dutch settlements on
  the Gold Coast to Britain in 1872&mdash;when the entire coast remained in
  British hands&mdash;the Ashantis reclaimed the sovereignty of the tribes
  round the settlement of Elmina. This brought on a war, leading to a
  British expedition in 1874, in which Coomassie was captured. In 1896 the
  country became a British protectorate. In 1901 a rebellion had to be put
  down, and next year Ashanti was fully annexed. Pop. 287,814

  <p><b>Asia</b>, the largest of the great divisions of the earth; length,
  from the extreme south-western point of Arabia, at the Strait of
  Bab-el-Mandeb, to the extreme north-eastern point of Siberia&mdash;East
  Cape, or Cape Vostochni, in Behring's Strait&mdash;6900 miles; breadth,
  from Cape Chelyuskin, in Northern Siberia, to Cape Romania, the southern
  extremity of the Malay Peninsula, 5300 miles; area estimated at
  17,250,000 sq. miles, about a third of all the land of the earth's
  surface. On three sides, <span class="scac">N.</span>, <span
  class="scac">E.</span>, and <span class="scac">S.</span>, the ocean forms
  its natural boundary, while in the <span class="scac">W.</span> the
  frontier is marked mainly by the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, Caspian
  Sea, the Caucasus, the Black Sea, the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, and
  the Red Sea. There is no proper separation between Asia and Europe, the
  latter being really a great peninsula of the former. Asia, though not so
  irregular in shape as Europe, is broken in the <span
  class="scac">S.</span> by three great peninsulas, Arabia, Hindustan, and
  Farther India, while the east coast presents peninsular projections and
  islands, forming a series of sheltered seas and bays, the principal
  peninsulas being Kamtshatka and Corea. The principal islands are those
  forming the Malay or Asiatic Archipelago, which stretch round in a wide
  curve on the <span class="scac">S.E.</span> of the continent. Besides the
  larger islands&mdash;Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Celebes, Mindanao, and Luzon
  (in the Philippine group)&mdash;there are countless smaller islands
  grouped round these. Other islands are Ceylon, in the <span
  class="scac">S.</span> of India; the Japanese Islands and Sakhalin on the
  <span class="scac">E.</span> of the continent; Formosa, <span
  class="scac">S.E.</span> of China; Cyprus, <span class="scac">S.</span>
  of Asia Minor; and New Siberia and Wrangell, in the Arctic Ocean.</p>

  <p>The mountain systems of Asia are of great extent, and their
  culminating points are the highest in the world. The greatest of all is
  the Himálaya system, which lies mainly between long. 70° and 100° <span
  class="scac">E.</span> and lat. 28° and 37° <span class="scac">N.</span>
  It extends, roughly speaking, from north-west to south-east, its total
  length being about 1500 miles, forming the northern barrier of Hindustan.
  The loftiest summits are Mount Everest, 29,002 feet high, Godwin-Austen,
  28,265, and Kanchinjinga, 28,156. The principal passes, which rise to the
  height of 18,000 to 20,000 feet, are the highest in the world. A second
  great mountain system of Central Asia, connected with the north-western
  extremity of the Himálaya system by the elevated region of Pamir (about
  long. 70°-75° <span class="scac">E.</span>, lat. 37°-40° <span
  class="scac">N.</span>), is the Thian-Shan system, which runs
  north-eastward for a distance of 1200 miles. In this direction the Altai,
  Sayan, and other ranges continue the line of elevations to the
  north-eastern coast. A north-western continuation of the Himálaya is the
  Hindu Kush, and farther westward a connection may be traced between the
  Himálaya mass and the Elburz range (18,460) feet, south of the Caspian,
  and thence to the mountains of Kurdistan, Armenia, and Asia Minor.</p>

  <p>There are vast plateaux and elevated valley regions connected with the
  great central mountain systems, but large portions of the continent are
  low and flat. Tibet forms the most elevated table-land in Asia, its mean
  height being estimated at 15,000 feet. On its south is the Himálayan
  range, while the Kuen-Lun range forms its northern barrier. Another great
  but much lower plateau is that which comprises Afghanistan, Baluchistan,
  and Persia, and which to the north-west joins into the plateau of Asia
  Minor. The principal plain of Asia is that of Siberia, which extends
  along the north of the continent and forms an immense alluvial tract
  sloping to the Arctic Ocean. Vast swamps or peat-mosses called
  <i>tundras</i> cover large portions of this region. South-west of
  Siberia, and stretching eastward from the Caspian, is a low-lying tract
  consisting to a great extent of steppes and deserts, and including in its
  area the Sea of Aral. In the east of China there is an alluvial plain of
  some 200,000 sq. miles in extent; in Hindustan are plains extending for
  2000 miles along the south slope of the Himálaya; and between Arabia and
  Persia, watered by the Tigris and Euphrates, is the plain of Mesopotamia
  or Assyria, one of the richest in the world. Of the deserts of Asia the
  largest is that of Gobi (long. 90°-120° <span class="scac">E.</span>,
  lat. 40°-48° <span class="scac">N.</span>), large portions of which are
  covered with nothing but sand or display a surface of bare rock. An
  almost continuous desert region may also be traced from the desert of
  North Africa through Arabia (which is largely occupied by bare <!-- Page
  275 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page275"></a>[275]</span>deserts),
  Persia, and Baluchistan to the Indus.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Some of the largest rivers of Asia flow northward to the Arctic
  Ocean&mdash;the Obi, the Yenisei, and the Lena. The Hoang-Ho and
  Yang-tse, and the Amoor, are the chief of those which flow into the
  Pacific. The Ganges, Brahmaputra, Irawadi, and Indus flow into the Indian
  Ocean. The Persian Gulf receives the united waters of the Euphrates and
  the Tigris. There are several systems of inland drainage, large rivers
  falling into lakes which have no outlet.</p>

  <p>The largest lake of Asia (partly also European) is the Caspian Sea,
  which receives the Kur from the Caucasus (with its tributary the Aras
  from Armenia), and the Sefid Rud and other streams from Persia (besides
  the Volga from European Russia, and the Ural, which is partly European,
  partly Asiatic). The Caspian lies in the centre of a great depression,
  being 83 feet below the level of the Sea of Azov. East from the Caspian
  is the Sea of Aral, which, like the Caspian, has no outlet, and is fed by
  the Rivers Amu-Darya (Oxus) and Syr-Darya. Still farther east, to the
  north of the Thian-Shan Mountains, and fed by the Ili and other streams,
  is Lake Balkhash, also without an outlet and very salt. Other lakes
  having no communication with the ocean are Lob Nor, in the desert of
  Gobi, receiving the River Tarim, and the Dead Sea, far below the level of
  the Mediterranean, and fed by the Jordan. The chief fresh-water lake is
  Lake Baikal, in the south of Siberia, between long. 104° and 110° E., a
  mountain lake from which the Yenisei draws a portion of its waters.</p>

  <p>Geologically speaking, large areas of Asia are of comparatively recent
  date, the lowlands of Siberia, for instance, being submerged during the
  tertiary period, if not more recently. Many geologists believe that
  subsequently to the glacial period there was a great sea in Western Asia,
  of which the Caspian and Aral Seas are the remains. The desiccation of
  Central Asia is still going on, as is also probably the upheaval of a
  great part of the continent. The great mountain chains and elevated
  plateaux are of ancient origin, however, and in them granite and other
  crystalline rocks are largely represented. Active volcanoes are only met
  with in the extreme east (Kamtchatka) and in the Eastern Archipelago.
  From the remotest times Asia has been celebrated for its mineral wealth.
  In the Altai and Ural Mountains gold, iron, lead, and platinum are found;
  in India and other parts rubies, diamonds, and other gems are, or have
  been, procured; salt in Central Asia; coal in China, India, Central Asia,
  &amp;c.; petroleum in the districts about the Caspian and in Burmah;
  bitumen in Syria; while silver, copper, sulphur, &amp;c., are found in
  various parts.</p>

  <p>Every variety of climate may be experienced in Asia, but as a whole it
  is marked by extremes of heat and cold and by great dryness, this in
  particular being the case with vast regions in the centre of the
  continent and distant from the sea. The great lowland region of Siberia
  has a short but very hot summer, and a long but intensely cold winter,
  the rivers and their estuaries being fast bound with ice, and at a
  certain depth the soil is hard frozen all the year round. The northern
  part of China to the east of Central Asia has a temperate climate with a
  warm summer, and in the extreme north a severe winter. The districts
  lying to the south of the central region, comprising the Indian and
  Indo-Chinese Peninsulas, Southern China, and the adjacent islands,
  present the characteristic climate and vegetation of the southern
  temperate and tropical regions modified by the effects of altitude. Some
  localities in Southern Asia have the heaviest rainfall anywhere known. As
  the equator is approached the extremes of temperature diminish till at
  the southern extremity of the continent they are such as may be
  experienced in any tropical country. Among climatic features are the
  monsoons of the Indian Ocean and the eastern seas, and the cyclones or
  typhoons, which are often very destructive.</p>

  <p>The plants and animals of Northern and Western Asia generally resemble
  those of similar latitudes in Europe (which is really a prolongation of
  the Asiatic continent), differing more in species than in genera. The
  principal mountain trees are the pine, larch, and birch; the willow,
  alder, and poplar are found in lower grounds. In the central region
  European species reach as far as the Western and Central Himálaya, but
  are rare in the Eastern. They are here met by Chinese and Japanese forms.
  The lower slopes of the Himálaya are clothed almost exclusively with
  tropical forms. Higher up, between 4000 and 10,000 feet, are found all
  the types of trees and plants that belong to the temperate zone, there
  being extensive forests of conifers. Here is the native home of the
  deodar cedar. The south-eastern region, including India, the Eastern
  Peninsula, and China, with the islands, contains a vast variety of plants
  useful to man and having here their original habitat, such as the
  sugar-cane, rice, cotton, and indigo, pepper, cinnamon, cassia, clove,
  nutmeg, and cardamoms, banana, coco-nut, areca, and sago palms; the mango
  and many other fruits, with plants producing a vast number of drugs,
  caoutchouc, and gutta-percha. The forests of India and the Malay
  Peninsula contain oak, teak, sâl, and other timber woods, besides
  bamboos, palms, sandal-wood, &amp;c. The palmyra palm is characteristic
  of Southern India; while the talipot palm flourishes on the western coast
  of Hindustan, Ceylon, and the Malay <!-- Page 276 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page276"></a>[276]</span>Peninsula. The
  cultivated plants of India and China include wheat, barley, rice, maize,
  millet, sugar-cane, tea, coffee, indigo, cotton, jute, opium, tobacco,
  &amp;c. In North China and the Japanese Islands large numbers of
  deciduous trees occur, such as oaks, maples, limes, walnuts, poplars, and
  willows, the genera being European but the individual species Asiatic.
  Among cultivated plants are wheat, and in favourable situations rice,
  cotton, the vine, &amp;c. Coffee, rice, sugar, &amp;c., are extensively
  grown in some of the islands of the Asiatic Archipelago. In Arabia and
  the warmer valleys of Persia, Afghanistan, and Baluchistan aromatic
  shrubs are abundant. Over large parts of these regions the date palm
  flourishes and affords a valuable article of food. Gum-producing acacias
  are, with the date palm, the commonest trees in Arabia. African forms are
  found extending from the Sahara along the desert region of Asia.</p>

  <p>Nearly all the mammals of Europe are found in Northern Asia, with
  numerous additions to the species. Central Asia is the native land of the
  horse, the ass, the ox, the sheep, and the goat. Both varieties of the
  camel, the single and the double humped, are Asiatic. To the inhabitants
  of Tibet and the higher plateaux of the Himálaya the yak is what the
  reindeer is to the tribes of the Siberian plain, almost their sole wealth
  and support. The elephant, of a different species from that of Africa, is
  a native of tropical Asia. The Asiatic lion, which inhabits Arabia and
  Persia, and still exists in the north-west of India, is smaller than the
  African species. Bears are found in all parts, the white bear in the far
  north, and other species in the more temperate and tropical parts. The
  tiger is the most characteristic of the larger Asiatic Carnivora. It is
  found in Armenia and throughout the entire continent, being absent,
  however, from the greater portion of Siberia and from the high table-land
  of Tibet; it is found also in Sumatra, Java, and Bali. In South-Eastern
  Asia and the islands we find the rhinoceros, buffalo, ox, deer,
  squirrels, porcupines, &amp;c. In birds nearly every order is
  represented. Among the most interesting forms are the hornbills, the
  peacock, the Impey pheasant, the tragopan or horned pheasant, and other
  gallinaceous birds, the pheasant family being very characteristic of
  South-Eastern Asia. It was from Asia that the common domestic fowl was
  introduced into Europe. The tropical parts of Asia abound in monkeys, of
  which the species are numerous. Some are tailed, others, such as the
  orang, are tailless, but none have prehensile tails like the American
  monkeys. In the Malay Archipelago marsupial animals, so characteristic of
  Australia, first occur in the Moluccas and Celebes, while various mammals
  common in the western part of the Archipelago are absent. A similar
  transition towards the Australian type takes place in the species of
  birds. (See <i>Wallace's Line</i>.) Of marine mammals the dugong is
  peculiar to the Indian Ocean; in the Ganges is found a peculiar species
  of dolphin. At the head of the reptiles stands the Gangetic crocodile,
  frequenting the Ganges and other large rivers. Among the serpents are the
  cobra de capello, one of the most deadly snakes in existence; there are
  also large boas and pythons, besides sea and fresh-water snakes. The seas
  and rivers produce a great variety of fish. The Salmonidæ are found in
  the rivers flowing into the Arctic Ocean. Two rather remarkable fishes
  are the climbing perch and the archer-fish. The well-known goldfish is a
  native of China.</p>

  <p>Asia is mainly peopled by races belonging to two great ethnographic
  types, the Caucasic or fair type, and the Mongolic or yellow. To the
  former belong the Aryan, or Indo-European, and the Semitic races, both of
  which mainly inhabit the south-west of the continent; to the latter
  belong the Malays and Indo-Chinese in the <span class="scac">S.E.</span>,
  as well as the Mongolians proper (Chinese, &amp;c.), occupying nearly all
  the rest of the continent. To these may be added certain races of
  doubtful affinities, as the Dravidians of Southern India, the Cingalese
  of Ceylon, the Ainos of Yesso, and some negro-like tribes called
  Negritos, which inhabit Malacca and the interior of several of the
  islands of the Eastern Archipelago. The total population is estimated at
  823,000,000, or more than half that of the whole world, of which
  330,000,000 inhabit Chinese territory, 302,000,000 British, and
  25,000,000 Russian. Portions of Asia are under the control of European
  Powers (Russia, Great Britain, Holland, France), of the United States of
  America, China, and Japan. The chief States are China, Japan, Corea,
  Siam, Afghanistan, Persia, and Arabia. The chief religions are the
  Brahmanism of India, the Buddhism of Burmah, China, &amp;c., the creeds
  of Confucius and Lao-tse in China, and the various forms of Mahommedanism
  in Arabia, Persia, India, &amp;c. More than a half of the whole
  population profess some form of Buddhism. Several native Christian sects
  are found in India, Armenia, Kurdistan, and Syria.</p>

  <p>Asia is generally regarded as the cradle of the human race. It
  possesses the oldest historical documents, and, next to the immediately
  contiguous kingdom of Egypt, the oldest historical monuments in the
  world. The Old Testament contains the oldest historical records which we
  have of any nation in the form of distinct narrative. The period at which
  Moses wrote was probably 1500 or 1600 years before the Christian era. His
  and the later Jewish writings confine themselves almost exclusively to
  the history of the Hebrews; but in Babylonia, as in Egypt, <!-- Page 277
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page277"></a>[277]</span>civilization
  had made great advances long before this time. The earliest seat of the
  Aryan race some assign to the banks of the Oxus. Hence, perhaps from the
  pressure of the Mongolian tribes to the north, they spread themselves to
  the south-east and south-west, finally occupying Northern India, Persia,
  and other parts of Western Asia, and spreading into Europe, perhaps about
  2000-1500 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> In China authentic history
  extends back probably to about 1000 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, with
  a long preceding period of which the names of dynasties are preserved
  without chronological arrangement. The kingdoms of Assyria, Babylonia,
  Media, and Persia predominated by turns in South-Western Asia. In regard
  to the history of these monarchies, much light has been obtained from the
  decipherment of the cuneiform inscriptions. The arms of the Pharaohs
  extended into Asia, but their conquests there were short-lived. From
  Cyrus (559 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), who extended the empire of
  Persia from the Indus to the Mediterranean, while his son, Cambyses,
  added Egypt and Libya to it, to the conquest of Alexander (330 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>) Persia was the dominant Power in Western Asia.
  Alexander's great empire became broken up into separate kingdoms, which
  were finally absorbed in the Roman Empire, and this ultimately extended
  to the Tigris. Soon after the most civilized portions of the three
  continents had been reduced under one empire, the great event took place
  which forms the dividing-line of history, the birth of Christ and the
  spread of Christianity. In <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 226 a
  protracted struggle began between the newer Persian Empire and the
  Romans, which lasted till the advent of Mahomet, and the conquests of the
  Arabians. Persia was the first great conquest of Mahomet's followers.
  Syria and Egypt soon fell before their arms, and within forty years of
  the celebrated flight of Mahomet from Mecca (the <i>Hejra</i>), the sixth
  of the caliphs, or successors of the Prophet, was the most powerful
  sovereign of Asia. The Mongols next became the dominant race. In 999
  Mahmud, whose father, born a Turkish slave, became Governor of Ghazni,
  conquered India, and established his rule. The dynasty of the Seljuk
  Tartars was established in Aleppo, Damascus, Iconium, and Kharism, and
  was distinguished for its struggles with the Crusaders. Othman, an emir
  of the Seljuk sultan of Iconium, established the Ottoman Empire in 1300.
  About 1220 Genghis Khan, an independent Mongol chief, made himself master
  of Central Asia, conquered Northern China, overran Turkestan,
  Afghanistan, and Persia; his successors took Bagdad and abolished the
  caliphate. In Asia Minor they overthrew the Seljuk dynasty. One of them,
  Timur or Tamerlane, carried fire and sword over Northern India and
  Western Asia, defeated and took prisoner Bajazet, the descendant of
  Othman (1402), and received tribute from the Greek emperor. The Ottoman
  Empire soon recovered from the blow inflicted by Timur, and
  Constantinople was taken and the Eastern Empire finally overthrown by the
  Sultan Mohammed II in 1453. China recovered its independence about 1368
  and was again subjected by the Manchu Tartars (1618-45), soon after which
  it began to extend its empire over Central Asia. Siberia was conquered by
  the Cossacks on behalf of Russia (1580-4). The same country effected a
  settlement in the Caucasus about 1786, and has since continued to make
  steady advances into Central Asia. The discovery by the Portuguese of the
  passage to India by the Cape of Good Hope led to their establishment on
  the coast of the peninsula (1498). They were speedily followed by the
  Spanish, Dutch, French, and British. The struggle between the two last
  Powers for the supremacy of India was completed by the destruction of the
  French settlements (1760-5). At present the forms of government in Asia
  range from the primitive rule of the nomad sheik to the constitutional
  monarchy of Japan.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography:</span> Sven

  <p><b>Asia, Central,</b> a designation loosely given to the regions in
  the centre of Asia east of the Caspian, also called Turkestan, and
  formerly Tartary. The eastern portion belongs to China, the western to
  Russia. Russian Central Asia comprises the Kirghiz Steppe (Uralsk,
  Turgai, Akmolinsk, Semipalatinsk, &amp;c.), and what was the
  government-general of Turkestan till 1918, besides the territory of the
  Turkomans, or Transcaspia and Merv. See <i>Turkestan, Republic
  of</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Asia Minor</b>, the most westerly portion of Asia, being the
  peninsula lying west of the Upper Euphrates, and forming part of Asiatic
  Turkey. It forms an extensive plateau, with lofty mountains rising above
  it, the most extensive ranges being the Taurus and Anti-Taurus, which
  border it on the south and south-east, and rise to over 10,000 feet.
  There are numerous salt- and freshwater lakes. The chief rivers are the
  Kizil-Irmak (Halys), Sakaria (Sangarius), entering the Black Sea; and the
  Sarabat (Hermus) and Menderes (Mæander), entering the Ægean. The coast
  regions are generally fertile, and have a genial climate; the interior is
  largely arid and dreary. Valuable forests and fruit-trees abound. Smyrna
  is the chief town. <i>Anatolia</i> is an equivalent name. See <i>European
  War</i>; <i>Turkey</i>. <!-- Page 278 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p><b>Asiago</b>, a town in Italy in the province of Vicenza, capital of
  the Seven Communes (Sette Communi). In the great European War several
  battles were fought on the Asiago Plateau. The town was evacuated by the
  Italians on 28th May, 1916, but retaken on 25th June, 1916. See

  <p><b>Asiatic Societies</b>, learned bodies instituted for the purpose of
  collecting information respecting the different countries of Asia, such
  as the Asiatic Society of Bengal, founded in 1784 by Sir William Jones;
  and the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, established
  by Colebrooke, and opened in 1823. There are similar societies on the
  European Continent and in America, such as the Société Asiatique at
  Paris, founded in 1822; the Oriental Society of Germany (Deutsche
  Morgenländische Gesellschaft), founded in 1845; and the Oriental Society
  at Boston, founded in 1842.</p>

  in Jan., 1881, after the sack of Geok Tepé. Its distance from Merv is 232
  miles, from Herat 388 miles. Pop. 54,000.</p>

  <p><b>As´kew</b>, Anne, a victim of religious persecution, born 1521,
  martyred 1546. She was a daughter of Sir William Askew of Lincolnshire,
  and was married to a wealthy neighbour named Kyme, who, irritated by her
  Protestantism, drove her from his house. In London, whither she went
  probably to procure a divorce, she spoke against the dogmas of the old
  faith, and, being tried, was condemned to death as a heretic. Being put
  to the rack to extort a confession concerning those with whom she
  corresponded, she continued firm, and was then taken to Smithfield,
  chained to a stake, and burned.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b>Asp</b>, or <b>Aspic</b> (<i>Naja</i>, or <i>Vip&#x115;ra
  haje</i>), a species of viper found in Egypt, resembling the cobra de
  capello or spectacle-serpent of the East Indies, and having a very
  venomous bite. When <!-- Page 279 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page279"></a>[279]</span>approached or disturbed it elevates its
  head and body, swells out its neck, and appears to stand erect to attack
  the aggressor. Hence the ancient Egyptians believed that the asps were
  guardians of the spots they inhabited, and the figure of this reptile was
  adopted as an emblem of the protecting genius of the world. The balancing
  motions made by it in the endeavour to maintain the erect attitude have
  led to the employment of the asp as a dancing serpent by the African
  jugglers. The "deaf adder that stoppeth her ear" of <i>Psalm</i> lviii,
  4, 5 is translated asp in the margin, and seems to have been this
  species. Cleopatra is said to have committed suicide by means of an asp's
  bite, but the incident is generally associated with the Cerastes or
  horned viper, not with the haje. The name asp is also given to a viper
  (<i>Vipera aspis</i>) common on the continent of Europe.</p>

  <p><b>Asparagine</b>, or <b>Aminosuccinamic Acid</b>,
  CH<sub>2</sub>CONH<sub>2</sub>, CH(NH<sub>2</sub>)COOH, is a white
  crystalline substance of unpleasant acid taste found in the shoots of
  asparagus, in potato and dahlia tribes, and in many other plants, from
  which it may be extracted by means of water.</p>

  <p><b>Aspar´agus</b> (<i>Aspar&#x103;gus officin&#x101;lis</i>), a plant
  of the order Liliaceæ, the young shoots of which, cut as they are
  emerging from the ground, are a favourite culinary vegetable. In Greece,
  and especially in the southern steppes of Russia and Poland, it is found
  in profusion; and its edible qualities were esteemed by the ancients.
  Pliny states that asparagus was in his time cultivated in gardens,
  particularly at Ravenna. The best asparagus is grown in gardens near the
  sea, and hundreds of acres are devoted to its cultivation in Holland and
  Belgium. It grows wild in Essex and Lincolnshire, but does not attain
  nearly to the size of the cultivated plant. It is usually raised from
  seed; and the plants should remain three years in the ground before they
  are cut; after which, for several years, they will continue to afford a
  regular annual supply. The beds are protected by straw or litter in
  winter. Its diuretic properties are ascribed to the presence of a
  crystalline substance found also in the potato, lettuce, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Aspa´sia</b>, a celebrated woman of ancient Greece, was born at
  Miletus, in Ionia, but passed a great part of her life at Athens, where
  her house was the general resort of the most distinguished men in Greece.
  She won the affection of Pericles, who united himself to Aspasia as
  closely as was permitted by the Athenian law, which declared marriage
  with a foreign woman illegal. Her power in the State has often been
  exaggerated, but it is beyond question that her genius left its mark upon
  the administration of Pericles. In 432-431 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>
  she was accused of impiety, and was only saved from condemnation by the
  eloquence and tears of Pericles. After his death (429 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>) Aspasia is said to have attached herself to a
  wealthy but obscure cattle-dealer of the name of Lysicles, whom she
  raised to a position of influence in Athens. Nothing more is known of her
  life. She had a son by Pericles, who was legitimated (430 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>) by a special decree of the people. There is a
  bust bearing her name in the Pio Clementino Museum in the Vatican.</p>

  <p><b>As´pect</b>, in astrology, denotes the situation of the planets
  with respect to each other. There are five different major aspects: the
  sextile, when the planets are 60° distant; quartile, when they are 90°
  distant; trine, when 120° distant; opposition, when 180° distant; and
  conjunction, when both are in the same longitude. The aspects were
  classed by astrologers as <i>benign</i>, <i>malignant</i>, or
  <i>indifferent</i>, according to their fancied influences upon human
  affairs.</p>

  <p><b>Asper´ula</b>, the woodruff genus of plants.</p>

  <p><b>Asphalt</b>, or <b>Asphal´tum</b>, the most common variety of
  bitumen; also called mineral pitch. Asphalt is a compact, glossy,
  brittle, black or brown mineral, which breaks with a polished fracture,
  melts easily with a strong pitchy odour when heated, and when pure burns
  without leaving any ashes. It is found in the earth in many parts of
  Asia, Europe, and America, and in a soft or liquid state on the surface
  of the <!-- Page 280 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page280"></a>[280]</span>Dead Sea, which, from this circumstance,
  was called <i>Asphalt&#x12B;tes</i>. It is of organic origin, the asphalt
  of the great Pitch Lake of Trinidad being derived from bituminous shales,
  containing vegetable remains in the process of transformation. Asphalt is
  produced artificially in making coal-gas. During the process much tarry
  matter is evolved and collected in retorts. If this be distilled, naphtha
  and other volatile matters escape, and asphalt is left behind. It is
  sometimes called <i>Jew's Pitch</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Asphalte</b> (or <b>Asphalt</b>) <b>Rock</b>, a limestone
  impregnated with bitumen, found in large quantities in various localities
  in Europe, as in the Val de Travers, Neufchâtel, Switzerland; in the
  department of Ain in France; in Alsace, Hanover, Holstein, Sicily,
  &amp;c. These rocks contain a variable quantity of bitumen (from 7 or 8
  to 20 or 30 per cent) naturally diffused through them. The Val de Travers
  asphalt was discovered in 1710. In 1837 an English patent was taken out
  for its application to roads, pavements, terraces, areas, roofs, &amp;c.
  Since then other asphalte-rocks, as well as artificial preparations made
  by mixing bitumen, gas-tar, pitch, or other materials with sand, chalk,
  &amp;c., have been brought into competition with it.</p>

  <p><b>As´phodel</b> (<i>Asphod&#x115;lus</i>), a genus of plants, ord.
  Liliaceæ, consisting of perennials, with fasciculated fleshy roots,
  flowers arranged in racemes, six stamens inserted at the base of the
  perianth, a sessile almost spherical ovary with two cells, each
  containing two ovules; fruit a capsule with three cells, in each of which
  there are, as a rule, two seeds. Two species are cultivated in Britain as
  garden flowers, the yellow asphodel (<i>Asphodelus lut&#x115;us</i>) and
  the white asphodel (<i>Asphodelus albus</i>). The English word 'daffodil'
  is a perversion of asphodel. The <i>Asphodelus ram&#x14D;sus</i>, which
  attains a height of 5 feet, is cultivated in Algeria and elsewhere, its
  tubercles yielding a very pure alcohol, and the residue, together with
  the stalks and leaves, being used in making pasteboard and paper. The
  asphodel was a favourite plant among the ancients, who were in the habit
  of planting it round their tombs. In Greek religion it is associated with
  Persephone, the dead, and the underworld.</p>

  <p><b>Asphyx´ia</b>, literally, the state of a living animal in which no
  pulsation can be perceived, but the term is more particularly applied to
  a suspension of the vital functions from causes hindering respiration.
  The normal accompaniments of death from asphyxia are dark fluid blood, a
  congested brain and exceedingly congested lungs, the general engorgement
  of the viscera, and an absence of blood from the left cavities of the
  heart while the right cavities and pulmonary artery are gorged. The
  restoration of asphyxiated persons has been successfully accomplished at
  long periods after apparent death. The attempt should be made to maintain
  the heat of the body and to secure the inflation of the lungs as in the
  case of the apparently drowned. See <i>Respiratory System</i>.</p>

  <p><b>As´pirator</b>, an instrument used to promote the flow of a gas
  from one vessel into another by means of a liquid. The simplest form of
  aspirator is a cylindrical vessel containing water, with a pipe at the
  upper end which communicates with the vessel containing the gas, and a
  pipe at the lower end also, with a stopcock and with its extremity bent
  up. By allowing a portion of the water to run off by the pipe at the
  lower part of the aspirator a measured quantity of air or other gas is
  sucked into the upper part.</p>

  <p><b>Asquith</b>, Herbert Henry, prominent politician of the Liberal
  party, born in 1852, educated at City of London School and Balliol
  College, Oxford, where he graduated with high distinction. Called to the
  Bar in 1876, he became Q.C. in 1890; in 1886 was elected member of
  Parliament for East Fife, and held his seat for this constituency
  uninterruptedly until Dec., 1918, when he was defeated. From 1892 to 1895
  he was Home Secretary, being also made a Privy Councillor in the former
  year. Both in regard to the South African War and various other
  questions, when out of office, he spoke more <!-- Page 281 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page281"></a>[281]</span>in harmony with the
  views of Lord Rosebery than with those of Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman, but
  under the latter he accepted the post of Chancellor of the Exchequer in
  the ministry formed in Dec., 1905. On the retirement of Sir Henry in 1908
  he succeeded him as Prime Minister. He at once hastened to draw up the
  Liberal reform programme, the list of measures including the Lloyd George
  Budget (1909), the Parliament Act (1911), the Insurance Act, and the
  Irish Home Rule Bill. In May, 1915, a cabinet crisis having resulted from
  disagreements, Asquith formed a Coalition Government, eight Unionists
  being admitted. Towards the end of 1916 there was a feeling in the
  country not only that the Coalition cabinet of twenty-three ministers was
  unwieldy, but that Mr. Asquith's Government was not sufficiently
  energetic and showed too much hesitation in dealing with the vital
  problems of the war. Mr. Asquith therefore resigned on 5th Dec., 1916,
  and Mr. Lloyd George formed a new ministry. Unseated in the General
  Election of 1918, Mr. Asquith accepted the invitation to stand for
  Paisley in 1920. He was returned by a majority of 2834.</p>

  <p><b>As´rael</b>, the Mahommedan angel of death, who takes the soul from

  <p><b>Ass</b> (<i>Equus as&#x12D;nus</i>), a species of the horse genus,
  supposed by Darwin to have sprung from the wild variety (<i>Asinus
  t&oelig;ni&#x14F;pus</i>) found in Abyssinia; by some writers to be a
  descendant of the <i>on&#x103;ger</i> or wild ass, inhabiting the
  mountainous deserts of Tartary, &amp;c.; and by others to have descended
  from the kiang or djiggetai (<i>A. hemi&#x14F;nus</i>) of South-Western
  Asia. The ass was used in Egypt long before the horse, and it played an
  important part in Homeric Greece. According to Aristotle, however, it was
  unknown in his time in Pontus, Scythia, and in the land of the Celts. The
  ass seems to have been introduced into England in the days of Ethelred,
  but did not become common before the end of the seventeenth century. Both
  in colour and size the ass is exceedingly variable, ranging from dark
  grey and reddish brown to white, and from the size of a Newfoundland dog
  in North India to that of a good-sized horse. In the south-western
  countries of Asia and in Egypt, in some districts of Southern Europe, as
  in Spain, and in Kentucky and Peru, great attention has been paid to
  selection and interbreeding, with a result no less remarkable than in the
  case of the horse. Thus in Syria there appear to be four distinct breeds:
  a light and graceful animal used by ladies, an Arab breed reserved for
  the saddle, an ass of heavier build in use for ploughing and draft
  purposes, and the large Damascus breed. The efforts made to raise the
  deteriorated British breed have only been partially successful. The male
  ass is mature at two years of age, the female still earlier. The she-ass
  carries her young eleven months. The teeth of the young ass follow the
  same order of appearance and renewal as those of the horse. The life of
  the ass does not usually exceed thirty years. It is in general much
  healthier than the horse, and is maintained in this condition by a
  smaller quantity and coarser quality of food; it is superior to the horse
  in its ability to carry heavy burdens over the most precipitous roads,
  and is in no respect its inferior in intelligence, despite the reputation
  for stupidity which it has borne from very ancient times. The skin is
  used as parchment to cover drums, &amp;c., and in the East is made into
  shagreen. The hybrid offspring of the horse and the female ass is the
  hinny, that of the ass and the mare is the mule; but the latter is by far
  the larger and more useful animal. Asses' milk, long celebrated for its
  sanative qualities, more closely resembles that of a woman than any
  other. It is very similar in taste, and throws up an equally fluid cream,
  which is not convertible into butter.</p>

  <p><b>Assam´</b>, one of the fifteen provinces of British India,
  separated from Eastern Bengal and reconstituted in 1912; area, 53,015 sq.
  miles. It forms a series of fertile valleys watered by the Brahmaputra
  and its tributaries, the valley of the Brahmaputra, which is the main
  one, consisting of rich alluvial plains, either but little elevated above
  the river, or so low that large extents of them are flooded for three or
  four days once or twice in the year, while the course of the river often
  changes. The climate is marked by great humidity, and malarious diseases
  are common in the low grounds; otherwise it is not unhealthy. The whole
  province, except the cultivated area, may be designated as forest, the
  trees including teak, sâl, sissoo, the date and sago palm, the areca palm
  (the betel-nut tree), the Indian fig tree, &amp;c. The article of most
  commercial importance is tea, which was first exported in 1838, and the
  yield of which is now over 100,000,000 pounds annually. Other crops
  raised are rice, Indian corn, pulse, oil-seeds, <!-- Page 282 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page282"></a>[282]</span>sugar-cane, hemp, jute,
  potatoes, &amp;c. In the jungles and forests roam herds of elephants, the
  rhinoceros, tiger, buffalo, leopard, bear, wild hog, jackal, fox, goat,
  and various kinds of deer. Among serpents are the python and the cobra.
  Pheasants, partridges, snipe, wild peacock, and many kinds of water-fowl
  abound. Coal, petroleum, and limestone are found in abundance; iron is
  smelted to a small extent; gold-dust is met with; lime is exported to
  Bengal. There is no single Assamese nationality, and the Assamese
  language is merely a modern dialect of Bengali. Pop. 6,713,635, 3,637,828
  of whom are Hindus, 1,886,528 Mahommedans, 66,430 Christians, 10,506
  Buddhists, the rest being chiefly hill tribes of aboriginal faiths. The
  labourers in the tea-gardens are mostly drawn from Bengal. In 1826 Assam
  became a possession of Britain, being taken from the Burmese, who had
  made themselves masters of it about the end of the eighteenth century.
  The largest town is Sylhet (pop. 14,000).&mdash;Cf. E.&nbsp;A. Gait,

  <p><b>Assass´ins</b> (from <i>hashsh&#x101;sh&#x12B;n</i>, drinkers of
  <i>hashish</i>), an Asiatic order or society having the practice of
  assassination as its most distinctive feature, founded by Hassan Ben
  Sabbah, the Himyarite, a <i>dai</i> or missionary of the heterodox
  Mahommedan sect the Ismailites. The society grew rapidly in numbers, and
  in 1090 the Persian fortress of Alamut fell into their hands. Other
  territories were added, and the order became a recognized military power.
  Its organization comprised seven ranks, at its head being the
  Sheikh-al-Jebala or 'Old man of the mountains'. Upon a select band fell
  the work of assassination, to which they were stimulated by the
  intoxicating influence of <i>hashish</i>. For nearly two centuries they
  maintained their power under nine sheikhs. Hassan, after a long and
  prosperous reign, died in 1124. Most of his successors died violent
  deaths at the hands of relatives or dependents. After proving themselves
  strong enough to withstand the powerful sultans Noureddin and Saladin,
  and making themselves feared by the Crusaders, the <i>Assassins</i> were
  overcome by the Tartar leader Hulaku. The last chief, Rokneddin, was
  killed for an act of treachery subsequent to his capture, and his death
  was followed by a general massacre of the assassins, in which 12,000
  perished. Dispersed bands led a roving life in the Syrian mountains, and
  it is alleged that in the Druses and other small existing tribes their
  descendants are still to be found. See <i>Crusades</i>; <i>Khoja</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Assault´</b>, in law, an attempt or offer, with force and violence,
  to do a corporal hurt to another, as by striking at him with or without a
  weapon. If a person lift up or stretch forth his arm and offer to strike
  another, or menace anyone with any staff or weapon, it is an assault in
  law. Assault, therefore, does not necessarily imply a hitting or blow,
  because in trespass for assault and battery a man may be found guilty of
  the assault and acquitted of the battery. But every battery includes an
  assault.</p>

  <p><b>Assaye</b>, or <b>Assye</b> (as-s&#x12B;´), a village in Southern
  India, in Hyderabad, where Wellington (then Major-General Wellesley)
  gained a famous victory in 1803. With only 4500 troops at his disposal he
  completely routed the Mahratta force of 50,000 men and 100 guns. The
  victory, however, cost him more than a third of his men.</p>

  <p><b>Assaying</b>, the estimation of the amount of pure metal present in
  an ore or an alloy. The term was originally applied to testing of gold
  and silver only. It is now usually applied to the determination of the
  quantity of valuable metal in an ore or alloy, and is also sometimes
  applied to the estimation of any element which may affect the value of
  the ore.</p>

  <p>Assaying, therefore, means the estimation of one or more metals in an
  ore or alloy. Before an assay can be made, an average sample of the
  material must be obtained. If an ore, pieces of material are taken from
  different parts of the vein or, if already mined, from different parts of
  the dump. The pieces are crushed up finely and divided into four equal
  parts. Two of these parts are then mixed and divided into four again, and
  so on until an average sample has been obtained. In the case of metals in
  ingots or bars, samples are obtained by drilling and chipping corners or
  edges. Coins, which are never homogeneous, may be rolled out into a thin
  sheet and cut into small pieces. A preliminary examination is made to
  determine the constituents. Finally an assay of the substance is made.
  The methods used are determined by the metals and the proportions of
  these present in the ore or alloy. Originally the term assaying was
  applied to dry methods, i.e. the substance was heated in a special
  crucible with a suitable flux, and a bead of metal was obtained which was
  weighed. An assay now may be carried out in various ways, for example, by
  fusing with a reducing agent and obtaining a bead of metal, or by
  dissolving the substance to be assayed in suitable solvent and
  precipitating the metal as an insoluble salt, or volumetric methods may
  be used. Dry assaying is still used for gold. The assay depends on first
  heating the gold ore or alloy with lead in a porous crucible, that is,
  <i>cupelling</i> it. Lead oxidizes on heating in a furnace; part
  volatilizes, and part of the oxide is absorbed by the cupel and carries
  with it oxides of other metals with the exception <!-- Page 283 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page283"></a>[283]</span>of gold and silver. The
  proportion of lead must be regulated, depending on the metals alloyed
  with gold. A bead is obtained containing gold and silver. This is beaten
  out into a thin plate, and then rolled out until it is thin enough to be
  rolled up by hand. The gold alloy is rolled up in the fingers into a
  cornette and treated with nitric acid. This dissolves silver, leaving a
  brittle cornette of gold, which is thoroughly washed, dried, and weighed.
  All gold alloys and silver alloys must be assayed, and their fineness
  stamped on them. The Goldsmith's Company of London is the statutory
  assay-master of England.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography:</span> C.

  and (according to the present practice) in the month of May, usually
  sitting for ten or twelve days. In its judicial capacity as a court of
  review, and as the court of last resort, the General Assembly has a right
  to determine finally every question brought from the inferior courts, by
  reference, complaint, or appeal. It possesses, besides, a general
  superintendence of the discipline of the Church, of the management of the
  inferior courts, of the conduct of the clergy, and of the morals of the
  people. In its legislative capacity it has the power of enacting statutes
  with regard to every subject of ecclesiastical cognizance, which are
  binding on the Assembly itself, on the inferior courts, and on the
  individual members of the Church. But by an Act of Assembly in 1697, from
  its substance and design named the Barrier Act, every proposition for a
  new law must first be considered in the form of an overture; and though
  it should be approved of by the Assembly it cannot be enacted as a
  statute till it has been first transmitted to the several presbyteries of
  the Church for their consideration, and has received the sanction of at
  least a majority of the presbyteries. The United Free Church of Scotland
  has also a General Assembly similar in its constitution and functions to
  that of the Established Church, and the same is the case with the
  Presbyterian Churches of Ireland and America.</p>

  <p><b>Assembly, National</b> (France), a body set up in France on the eve
  of the Revolution. Upon the convocation of the States-General by Louis
  XVI the privileged nobles and clergy refused to deliberate in the same
  chamber with the commons or <i>tiers-état</i> (third estate). The latter,
  therefore, on the proposition of the Abbé Siéyès, constituted themselves
  an <i>assemblée nationale</i>, with legislative powers (17th June, 1789).
  They bound themselves by oath not to separate until they had furnished
  France with a constitution, and the Court was compelled to give its
  assent. In the 3250 decrees passed by the Assembly were laid the
  foundations of a new epoch, and, having accomplished this task, it
  dissolved itself, 30th Sept., 1791.</p>

  <p><b>Assembly of Divines.</b> See <i>Westminster Assembly</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Assembly, The Right of</b>, is an essential principle of popular
  government, as understood by the British and American constitutions. The
  right of British citizens to assemble peaceably for any purpose which is
  not strictly prohibited by law is implied in the right of petition, as
  affirmed in the Bill of Rights (q.v.). Unlawful assembly, which is a
  criminal offence, is distinguished from the offence of riot. Whilst the
  latter is an actual attempt to carry an unlawful purpose into effect, the
  former is defined as "an assembly with intent to carry out a common
  purpose which may lead to a breach of the peace".</p>

  <p><b>As´sen</b>, chief town of the province of Drenthe, Holland. Pop.
  13,000.</p>

  <p><b>Assent´, The Royal</b>, is the approbation given by the sovereign
  in Parliament to a Bill which has passed both Houses, after which it
  becomes a law. It may either be done in person, when the sovereign comes
  to the House of Peers and the assent (in Norman French) is declared by
  the Clerk of Parliament; or it may be done by letters-patent under the
  great seal, signed by the sovereign.</p>

  <p><b>As´ser, John</b>, a learned British ecclesiastic, originally a monk
  of St. David's, distinguished as the instructor, companion, and
  biographer of Alfred the Great, who appointed him abbot of two or three
  different monasteries, and finally Bishop of Sherborne, where he died in
  908 or 910. His life of Alfred, written in Latin in 893 (<i>Annales Rerum
  Gestarum Ælfredi Magni</i>), is of very great value, though its
  authenticity has been questioned. There are several English translations
  of it.</p>

  <p><b>Assessed Taxes</b>, taxes charged upon persons by means of a
  schedule or paper sent to each, and strictly including such taxes as the
  income-tax, the house-tax, local rates, &amp;c. In Britain the so-called
  assessed taxes include those upon servants, carriages, dogs, armorial
  bearings, &amp;c., though these are really excise licence duties.</p>

  <p><b>Asses´sor</b>, a person appointed to ascertain and fix the amount
  of taxes, rates, &amp;c.; or a <!-- Page 284 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page284"></a>[284]</span>person who sits along with the judges in
  certain courts, and assists them with his professional knowledge.</p>

  <p><b>As´sets</b> (Fr. <i>assez</i>, enough), property or goods available
  for the payment of a bankrupt or deceased person's obligations. Assets
  are personal or real, the former comprising all goods, chattels, &amp;c.,
  devolving upon the executor as saleable to discharge debts and legacies.
  In commerce and bankruptcy the term is often used as the antithesis of
  'liabilities', to designate the stock in trade and entire property of an
  individual or an association.&mdash;<i>Intangible</i> (or fictitious)
  assets are those not represented by any existing value, e.g. goodwill;
  <i>liquid</i> assets are cash, investments, or other immediately
  available funds.</p>

  <p><b>Asside´ans</b>, <b>Haside´ans</b>, or <b>Hasidim</b> ('the pious'),
  one of the two great sects into which, after the Babylonish captivity,
  the Jews were divided with regard to the observance of the law&mdash;the
  Hasidim accepting it in its later developments, the Zadikim professing
  adherence only to the law as given by Moses. See <i>Pharisees</i>,
  <i>Talmudists</i>, <i>Rabbinists</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Assien´to</b>, the permission of the Spanish Government to a
  foreign nation to import negro slaves from Africa into the Spanish
  colonies in America, for a limited time, on payment of certain duties. It
  was accorded to the Netherlands about 1552, to the Genoese in 1580, and
  to the French Guinea Company (afterwards the Assiento Company) in 1702.
  In 1713 the celebrated <i>Assiento Treaty</i> with Britain for thirty
  years was concluded at Utrecht. By this contract the British obtained the
  right to send yearly a ship of 500 tons, with all sorts of merchandise,
  to the Spanish colonies. This led to frequent abuses and contraband
  trade; acts of violence followed, and in 1739 a war broke out between the
  two Powers. At the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, four years more
  were granted to the British; but by the Treaty of Madrid, two years
  later, £100,000 sterling were promised for the relinquishment of the two
  remaining years, and the contract was annulled.</p>

  <p><b>Assignats</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>s-&#x113;-nya<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>), the name of the national paper
  currency in the time of the French Revolution. Assignats to the value of
  400,000,000 francs were first struck off by the Constituent Assembly,
  with the approbation of the king, 19th April, 1790, to be redeemed with
  the proceeds of the sale of the confiscated goods of the Church. On the
  27th Aug. of the same year Mirabeau urged the issuing of 2,000,000,000
  francs of new assignats, which caused a dispute in the Assembly. Vergasse
  and Dupont, who saw that the plan was an invention of Clavière for his
  own enrichment, particularly distinguished themselves as the opponents of
  the scheme. Mirabeau's exertions, however, were seconded by Péthion, and
  800,000,000 francs more were issued. They were increased by degrees to
  45,578,000,000, and their value rapidly declined. In the winter of 1792-3
  they lost 30 per cent, and, in spite of the law to compel their
  acceptance at their nominal value, they continued to fall, till in the
  spring of 1796 they had sunk to one three hundred and forty-fourth their
  nominal value. This depreciation was due partly to the want of confidence
  in the stability of the Government, partly to the fact that the
  coarsely-executed and easily-counterfeited assignats were forged in great
  numbers. They were withdrawn by the Directory from the currency, and at
  length redeemed by mandats at one-thirtieth of their nominal value.</p>

  <p><b>Assignee´</b>, a person appointed by another to transact some
  business, or exercise some particular privilege or power. Formerly the
  persons appointed under a commission of bankruptcy, to manage the estate
  of the bankrupt on behalf of the creditors, were so called, but now they
  are called <i>trustees</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Assign´ment</b> is a transfer by deed of any property, or right,
  title, or interest in property, real or personal. Assignments are usually
  given for leases, mortgages, and funded property.</p>

  <p><b>Assiniboi´a</b>, the smallest of the four districts into which that
  portion of the north-western territories of Canada now forming the
  provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta was divided in 1882. It lay on the
  west of Manitoba, with Saskatchewan on the north and Alberta on the west,
  the United States on the south. The name is now given to an electoral
  district of the province of Saskatchewan. The region contains much good
  wheat land. Regina was the capital, as it now is of the new province.</p>

  <p><b>Assiniboine</b>, a river of Canada, which flows through Manitoba
  and joins the Red River at Winnipeg, about 40 miles above the entrance of
  the latter into Lake Winnipeg, after a somewhat circuitous course of
  about 500 miles from the west and north-west. Steamers ply on it for over
  300 miles.</p>

  <p><b>Assiout.</b> See <i>Siout</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Assisi</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>s-s&#x113;'s&#x113;), a small town in
  Italy, in the province of Umbria, 20 miles north of Spoleto, the see of a
  bishop, and famous as the birthplace of St. Francis d'Assisi. The
  splendid church built over the chapel where the saint received his first
  impulse to devotion is one of the finest remains of mediæval Gothic
  architecture.</p>

  <p><b>Assi´zes</b>, a term chiefly used in England to signify the
  sessions of the courts held at Westminster prior to Magna Charta, but
  thereafter appointed by successive enactments to be held annually in
  every county. Twelve judges, who are members of the highest courts in
  England, twice in every year perform a <i>circuit</i> into all the
  counties into which the kingdom is divided (the <!-- Page 285 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page285"></a>[285]</span>counties being grouped
  into seven circuits), to hold these assizes, at which both civil and
  criminal cases are decided. Occasionally this circuit is performed a
  third time for the purpose of jail-delivery. In London and Middlesex,
  instead of circuits, courts of <i>nisi prius</i> are held. At the assizes
  all the justices of the peace of the county are bound to attend. Special
  commissions of assize are granted for inquest into certain causes. In
  Scotland the term <i>assize</i> is still applicable to the jury in
  criminal cases.</p>

  <p>Among the more important historic uses of the term <i>assize</i> are
  its application to any sitting or deliberative council, and its
  transference thence to their ordinances, decrees, or assessments. In the
  latter sense we have the Assizes of Jerusalem, a code of feudal laws
  formulated in 1099 under Godfrey of Bouillon; the Assizes of Clarendon
  (1166), of Northampton (1176), and of Woodstock (1184); also the
  <i>assisæ venalium</i> (1203), for regulating the prices of articles of
  common consumption; the Assize of Arms (1181), an ordinance for
  organizing the national militia, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Assmanshausen.</b> See <i>Asmannshausen</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Associated Counties</b>, a term applied to Essex, Cambridge,
  Norfolk, Suffolk, and Hertford, with, subsequently, Huntingdon and
  Lincoln. The association was formed in 1642 to raise an army for the
  Parliament and keep the war out of their own districts. The successive
  leaders were Lord Grey of Wark, the Earl of Manchester, and Cromwell.</p>

  <p><b>Association of Ideas</b>, a doctrine of both psychological and
  philosophical import. In psychology the term is used to comprise the
  conditions under which one idea is able to recall another to
  consciousness. It is, therefore, the doctrine which deals with the
  reproduction of past experience by a present object of consciousness. The
  phrase 'association of ideas' was first introduced by Locke, and dealt
  with by Berkeley and Hartley, who became the founder of the so-called
  <i>Associationist School</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Ass´onance</b>, in poetry, a term used when the terminating words
  of lines have the same vowel sound but make no proper rhyme. Such verses,
  having what we should consider false rhymes, are regularly employed in
  Spanish poetry; but cases are not wanting in leading British poets. Mrs.
  Browning not only used them frequently, but justified the use of
  them.</p>

  <p><b>Assouan</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>s-s&#x14D;-a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>n´), or <b>Aswan</b>
  (<i>Sy&#x113;n&#x113;</i>), a town of Upper Egypt, on the east bank of
  the Nile, below the first cataract, opposite the Island of Elephantine.
  The granite quarries of the Pharaohs are here. Pop. 15,000.</p>

  <p><b>Assouan Dam</b>, a great dam constructed across the Nile in Upper
  Egypt, near Assouan, at the foot of the first cataract. It is about a
  mile and a quarter long, and is provided with a large number of sluices
  in two tiers. It was originally built to a height of about 96 feet
  between 1898 and 1902, and raised to a height of 112 feet above bed-rock
  between 1907 and 1911. It is intended to regulate the supply of water for
  irrigation purposes to the country lower down, the water being stored up
  at the time when the river is high, and allowed to escape when it is
  required for the crops. When the reservoir is full it forms a lake about
  130 miles long. The dam was planned by Sir William Willcocks, and the
  work carried out under Sir William Garstin and Sir Benjamin Baker, at a
  cost of £5,000,000 (Egyptian).</p>

  <p><b>Assump´sit</b>, in English law, an action to recover compensation
  for the non-performance of a <i>parole</i> promise; that is, a promise
  not contained in a deed under seal. Assumpsits are of two kinds,
  <i>express</i> and <i>implied</i>. The former are where the contracts are
  actually made in word or writing; the latter are such as the law implies
  from the justice of the case; e.g. employment to do work implies a
  promise to pay.</p>

  <p><b>Assumption.</b> See <i>Asuncion</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Assumption, Feast of</b>, the ecclesiastical festival celebrating
  the miraculous ascent into Heaven of the Virgin Mary's body as well as
  her soul, kept on the 15th of August. The legend first appeared in the
  third or fourth century, and the festival was instituted some three
  centuries later.</p>

  <p><b>Assyr´ia</b> (the <b>Asshur</b> of the Hebrews, <b>Athurâ</b> of
  the ancient Persians), an ancient monarchy in Asia, intersected by the
  upper course of the Tigris, and having the Armenian Mountains on the
  north and Babylonia on the south; area, about 50,000 sq. miles; surface
  partly mountainous, hilly, or undulating, partly a portion of the fertile
  Mesopotamian plain. The numerous remains of ancient habitations show how
  thickly this vast flat must have once been <!-- Page 286 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page286"></a>[286]</span>peopled; now, for the
  most part, it is a mere wilderness. Geographically and historically,
  however, Assyria and Babylonia are interdependent, and the Assyrians and
  Babylonians are ethnographically and linguistically the same race.
  Whereas, however, the classical authors speak of Assyria to the exclusion
  of Babylonia, the decipherment of the inscriptions has proved that
  Babylonia was the mother-country, and that Assyria, except during a
  period of eight centuries, was a dependency of the former. This discovery
  coincides with the contents of the tenth chapter of <i>Genesis</i>. See
  <i>Babylonia</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Ast</b>, Georg Anton Friedrich, German philosopher, 1776-1841. He
  wrote on æsthetics and the history of philosophy, but is best known as an
  editor of Plato, whose works he published with a Latin translation and
  commentary.</p>

  <p><b>As´tacus.</b> See <i>Crayfish</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Astar´te</b>, a Syrian goddess, probably corresponding to the
  <i>Ashtaroth</i> of the Hebrews, and representing the productive power of
  nature. She was a moon-goddess. Some regard her as corresponding to
  <i>Hera</i> (<i>Juno</i>), and others identify her with
  <i>Aphrodit&#x113;</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Astatic needle</b>, a magnetic needle having another needle of the
  same intensity fixed parallel to it, the poles being reversed, so that
  the needles neutralize one another, and are unaffected by the earth's
  magnetism; used in the <i>astatic galvanometer</i>.</p>

  <p><b>As´ter</b>, a genus of plants, nat. ord. Compositæ, comprehending
  several hundred species, scattered over Europe and Asia, but mostly
  natives of North America. Many are cultivated as ornamental plants. One,
  <i>A. Tripolium</i>, is native in Britain, and is found in salt marshes,
  having a pretty purple flower. Asters generally flower late in the
  season, and some are hence called Michaelmas or Christmas Daisies. The
  China Aster, not an aster proper (<i>Aster</i> or <i>Callist&#x115;phus
  chinensis</i>), is a very showy annual, of which there are many
  varieties.</p>

  <p><b>Asterabad´.</b> See <i>Astrabad</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Aste´ria</b>, a name applied to a variety of corundum, which

  precautions; and also to the <i>cat's-eye</i>, which consists of quartz,
  and is found especially in Ceylon.</p>

  <p><b>Aster´idæ.</b> See <i>Asteroidea</i>.</p>

  <p><b>As´terisk</b>, the figure of a star, thus *, used in printing and

  the space when a name, or the like, is omitted.</p>

  <p><b>Asteroi´dea</b>, the ord. of the Echinodermata to which the
  star-fishes belong. See <i>Star-fishes</i>.</p>

  <p><b>As´teroids</b>, <b>Planetoids</b>, or <b>Minor Planets</b>, a
  numerous group of very small planets revolving round the sun, in the
  great majority of cases at mean distances, intermediate between those of
  Mars and Jupiter, in orbits of large eccentricity at considerable
  inclination to the ecliptic. The diameter of the largest is not supposed
  to exceed 450 miles, while most of the others are very much smaller. Over
  one thousand are known, and new members are being constantly discovered.
  The first to be discovered was Ceres, on 1st Jan., 1801, and within seven
  years more Pallas, Juno, and Vesta were seen. The diminutive size of
  these four bodies, and resemblances in their orbits, gave rise to the
  opinion that they were but the fragments of a planet that had formerly
  existed and had been brought to an end by some catastrophe. For nearly
  forty years investigations were carried on, but no more planets were
  discovered till 8th Dec., 1845, when a fifth planet in the same region of
  the solar system was discovered. The rapid succession of discoveries that
  followed was for a time taken as a corroboration of the disruption
  theory, but the breadth of the zone occupied makes the hypothesis of a
  shattered planet more than doubtful. In recent years a few have been
  discovered which are at times considerably within the orbit of Mars, the
  nearest perihelia being less than 15 million miles beyond the earth's
  orbit. Another group, known as the 'Trojan Planets', has been found,
  whose mean distances are practically identical with that of Jupiter. The
  total mass of the asteroids cannot exceed one-fourth that of the earth,
  and is probably much less. See <i>Planets</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Asterol´epis</b>, a genus of primitive ganoid fishes, found only in
  a fossil state in the Old Red Sandstone. They were about 1 foot long, and
  the head and body were enclosed in armour of strong bony plates.</p>

  <p><b>Asthma</b> (ast´ma), difficulty of respiration, returning at
  intervals, with a sense of stricture across the chest and in the lungs, a
  wheezing, hard cough at first, but more free towards the close of each
  paroxysm, with a discharge of mucus, followed by a remission. Asthma is
  essentially a spasm of the muscular tissue which is contained in the
  smaller bronchial tubes. It generally attacks persons advanced in years,
  and seems, in some instances, to be hereditary. The exciting causes are
  various&mdash;accumulation of blood or viscid mucus in the lungs, noxious
  vapours, a cold and foggy atmosphere, or a close, hot air, flatulence,
  accumulated fæces, violent passions, organic diseases in the thoracic
  viscera, &amp;c. In recent years a treatment first used by Dr. Alexander
  Francis has come into prominence. By far the most important part of the
  treatment consists in obviating or removing the several exciting causes.
  It seldom proves fatal except as inducing dropsy, consumption,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Asti</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>s´t&#x113;), a town of Northern Italy,
  province of Alessandria, 28 miles <span class="scac">E.S.E.</span> of
  Turin, the see of <!-- Page 287 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page287"></a>[287]</span>a bishop, with an old cathedral. In the
  Middle Ages it was one of the most powerful republics of Northern Italy.
  It was the birthplace of Alfieri, the poet, whose statue adorns the
  principal square. There is also an equestrian statue of King Humbert. The
  industries comprise silk, matches, gold, mosaic wares, &amp;c. A
  favourite wine is produced in the neighbourhood. Asti, anciently
  <i>Asta</i>, was a place of some importance under the Roman emperors, and
  in the Middle Ages was an independent republic. Pop. 41,252.</p>

  <p><b>Astig´matism</b> (Gr. <i>a</i>, not, <i>stigma</i>, spot, mark), a
  malformation or imperfection, congenital or accidental, of the globe of
  the eye, in consequence of which the individual does not see objects
  clear and distinct, but with a blurred outline. It is due to the cornea
  or transparent outer coat of the eye not being regularly spherical, but
  having different degrees of curvature in different directions. Usually
  the degree of convexity is not the same horizontally as it is vertically,
  so that the rays from an object, instead of converging into one focus,
  meet in more than one. If a person with this defect is looking at
  vertical lines crossed by horizontal ones he will see the one set more
  distinctly than the other, though a slight movement will enable him to
  see the other distinctly also, but not at the same time. Almost all eyes
  are more or less astigmatic, but persons only become aware of it when it
  is excessive. Special lenses are required to correct it&mdash;usually
  lenses plane in one direction and concave or convex in the other. Short
  sight or long sight is often associated with astigmatism, so that
  suitable spectacles cannot be very easily provided.</p>

  <p><b>Astle</b>, Thomas, English antiquary, born 1735, died 1803. He was
  a trustee of the British Museum and keeper of the public records in the
  Tower. His chief work, <i>The Origin and Progress of Writing</i>,
  appeared in 1784, and the portion dealing with mediæval handwriting is
  still of value. He formed a famous collection of MSS., the most valuable
  portion of which is now in the British Museum.</p>

  <p><b>Astom´ata</b>, one of the two groups into which the Protozoa are
  divided with regard to the presence or absence of a mouth, of which organ
  the Astomata are destitute. The group comprises two classes, Gregarinida
  and Rhizopoda. See <i>Stomatoda</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Aston Manor</b>, formerly a municipal and parliamentary borough of
  Warwickshire, England, situated about 1½ miles <span
  class="scac">E.N.E.</span> of Birmingham, and engaged in similar branches
  of industry. It was incorporated with Birmingham in 1911 and gives its
  name to one of its parliamentary divisions. Pop. 75,029.</p>

  <p><b>Astor</b>, John Jacob, born near Heidelberg, Germany, 1703, died at
  New York, 1848. In 1783 he emigrated to the United States, settled at New
  York, and became extensively engaged in the fur trade. In 1811 the
  settlement of Astoria, founded by him, near the mouth of the Columbia
  River, was formed to serve as a central depot for the fur trade between
  the lakes and the Pacific. He subsequently engaged in various
  speculations, and died worth £4,000,000, leaving £80,000 to found the
  Astor Library in New York. This institution is contained in a splendid
  building, enlarged in 1859 at the cost of his son, and comprises about
  260,000 volumes. Since 1895 it has formed part of the New York public
  library.&mdash;His great-grandson, William Waldorf Astor, born in 1848,
  died in 1919, naturalized in England in 1899, was made a baron in 1916
  and a viscount in 1917.</p>

  <p><b>Astor, Lady.</b> Nancy Witcher, Viscountess Astor, married the
  second Viscount Astor in 1906. She is a daughter of the late Colonel
  Chiswell Dabney Langhorne, of Virginia, United States. In Nov., 1919, she
  was elected member of Parliament for the Sutton division of Plymouth, and
  was the first woman to take a seat in the House of Commons.</p>

  <p><b>Astor´ga</b>, a city of Spain, province of Leon; the <i>Asturica
  Augusta</i> of the Romans. It figured prominently during the Peninsular
  War; it was taken by the French after an obstinate defence, 1810, and
  retaken by the Spaniards, 1812. Pop. 5682.</p>

  <p><b>Asto´ria</b>, a town of Oregon, United States, on the Columbia
  River, with numerous salmon-canning establishments. Pop. 10,595. See
  <i>Astor</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Astrabad´</b>, a town of Persia, province of same name, about 24
  miles <span class="scac">E.</span> of the Caspian. It was formerly the
  residence of the Kajar princes, the ancestors of the present Persian
  dynasty. It is very unhealthy, but is still the centre of a considerable
  trade. Pop. estimated at from 10,000 to 30,000. The province of Astrabad
  has an area of 5800 sq. miles, and a pop. of 150,000.</p>

  <p><b>Astræ´a</b>, in Greek mythology, the daughter of Zeus and Themis,
  the goddess of justice. During the golden age she dwelt on earth, but on
  that age passing away she withdrew from the society of men and was placed
  among the stars, where she forms the constellation Virgo. The name was
  given to one of the asteroids, discovered in 1845. It revolves round the
  sun in 1511.10 solar days, and is about 2½ times the distance of the
  earth from the sun.</p>

  <p><b>As´tragal</b>, in architecture, a small semicircular moulding, with

  miles above its mouth in the Caspian, communicating with the opposite
  banks of the river by numerous bridges. It is the seat of a Greek
  archbishop and has a large cathedral, as well as places of worship for
  Mahommedans, Armenians, &amp;c. The manufactures are large and
  increasing, and the fisheries (sturgeon, &amp;c.) very important. It is
  the chief port of the Caspian, and has regular steam communication with
  the principal towns on its shores. In 1919 the town was made a naval base
  by the Bolshevist Government of Moscow. Pop. 163,800, composed of various
  races.&mdash;The government (or province) has an area of 91,042 sq.
  miles. It consists almost entirely of two vast steppes, separated from
  each other by the Volga, and forming for the most part arid sterile
  deserts. In 1918 the district of Astrakhan proclaimed its autonomy and
  independence of Moscow. Pop. 1,427,500.</p>

  The name was formerly used as equivalent to astronomy, but is now
  restricted in meaning to the pseudo-science which pretends to enable men
  to judge of the effects and influences of the heavenly bodies on human
  and other mundane affairs, and to foretell future events by their
  situations and conjunctions. As usually practised, the whole heavens,
  visible and invisible, were divided by great circles into twelve equal
  parts, called <i>houses</i>. As the circles were supposed to remain
  immovable, every heavenly body passed through each of the twelve houses
  every twenty-four hours. The portion of the zodiac contained in each
  house was the part to which chief attention was paid, and the position of
  any planet was settled by its distance from the boundary circle of the
  house, measured on the ecliptic. The houses had different names and
  different powers, the first being called the house of life, the second
  the house of riches, the third of brethren, the sixth of marriage, the
  eighth of death, and so on. The part of the heavens about to rise was
  called the <i>ascendant</i>, the planet within the house of the ascendant
  being <i>lord of the ascendant</i>. The different <i>aspects</i> of the
  planets were of great importance. To <i>cast a person's nativity</i> (or
  <i>draw his horoscope</i>) was to find the position of the heavens at the
  instant of his birth, which being done, the astrologer, who knew the
  various powers and influences possessed by the sun, the moon, and the
  planets, could predict what the course and termination of that person's
  life would be. The temperament of the individual was ascribed to the
  planet under which he was born, as <i>saturnine</i> from <i>Saturn</i>,
  <i>jovial</i> from <i>Jupiter</i>, <i>mercurial</i> from <i>Mercury</i>,
  <i>&amp;c.</i>, words which are now used with little thought of their
  original meaning. The virtues of herbs, gems, and medicines were supposed
  to be due to their ruling planets. The history of astrology, which was
  the foster-sister of astronomy, goes back to the early days of the human
  race. Egyptians and Hindus, as well as the nations on the Euphrates and
  Tigris, were zealous astrologers. The Christian Church strongly opposed
  the teachings of astrology, but its study spread among Jews and Arabs
  during the Middle Ages. Francis Bacon abused the astrologers of his day,
  and Swift wrote against them his famous <i>Prediction for the Year 1708,
  by Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq.</i>&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Astron´omy</b> (from Gr. <i>astron</i>, a heavenly body, and
  <i>nemein</i>, to classify or arrange) is that science which investigates
  the motions, distances, magnitudes, and various phenomena of the heavenly
  bodies. The science may be divided into several branches. <i>Descriptive
  astronomy</i> denotes merely a presentation of astronomical facts in a
  systematic but popular form; <i>practical astronomy</i> treats of the
  instruments used in observing the celestial bodies, the methods <!-- Page
  289 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page289"></a>[289]</span>of their
  employment, and the manner of deducing results from the observations;
  investigation of the causes of the motions of these bodies was formerly
  termed <i>physical astronomy</i>, but now generally <i>dynamical</i> or
  <i>gravitational astronomy</i>; <i>physical astronomy</i> or
  <i>astro-physics</i> is the comparatively modern branch which deals with
  their physical conditions, radiation, temperature, and chemical
  constitution. Recent years have added two new fields of investigation
  which are full of promise for the advancement of astronomical science.
  The first of these&mdash;<i>celestial photography</i>&mdash;has furnished
  us with invaluable light-pictures of the sun, moon, and other bodies, and
  has recorded the existence of myriads of stars invisible even to the best
  telescopes; while the second, <i>spectrum analysis</i>, now employed by
  many scientists, reveals to us a knowledge of the physical constituents
  of the universe, telling us for instance that in the sun (or his
  atmosphere) there exist many of the elements familiar to us on the earth.
  It is also applied to the determination of the velocities with which
  stars are approaching, or receding from, our system; and to the
  measurement of movements taking place within the solar atmospheric
  envelopes. From analysis of some of the unresolved nebulæ the inference
  is drawn that they are not star-swarms but simply incandescent gas;
  whence a second inference results favourable to the hypothesis of the
  gradual condensation of nebulæ, and the successive evolutions of suns and
  systems.</p>

  <p>The most remote period to which we can go back in tracing the history
  of astronomy refers us to a time about 2500 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, when the Chinese are said to have recorded the
  simultaneous conjunction of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, and the moon.
  This remarkable phenomenon is found, by calculating backward, to have
  taken place 2460 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> Astronomy has also an
  undoubtedly high antiquity in India. The mean annual motion of Jupiter
  and Saturn was observed as early as 3062 years <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>; tables of the sun, moon, and planets were
  formed, and eclipses calculated. In the time of Alexander the Great, the
  Chaldeans or Babylonians had carried on astronomical observations for
  1900 years. They regarded comets as bodies travelling in extended orbits,
  and predicted their return; and there is reason to believe that they had
  correct ideas regarding the solar system. The priests of Egypt gave
  astronomy a religious character; but their knowledge of the science is
  testified to only by their ancient zodiacs and the position of their
  pyramids with relation to the cardinal points. It was among the Greeks
  that astronomy took a more scientific form. Thales of Miletus (born 639
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>) predicted a solar eclipse, and his
  successors held opinions which are in many respects wonderfully in
  accordance with modern ideas. Pythagoras (500 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>) and his followers formed theories of the
  planetary system. They taught the sphericity and revolution of the earth,
  but placed an imaginary 'Central Fire', not the sun itself, at the centre
  of the system. Great progress was made in astronomy under the Ptolemies,
  and we find Timochares and Aristyllus employed about 300 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> in making useful planetary observations. But
  Aristarchus of Samos (born 267 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>) is said,
  on the authority of Archimedes, to have far surpassed them, by teaching
  the double motion of the earth around its axis and around the sun. A
  hundred years later Hipparchus determined more exactly the length of the
  solar year, and the eccentricity of the ecliptic, discovered the
  precession of the equinoxes, and even undertook a catalogue of the stars.
  It was in the second century after Christ that Claudius Ptolemy, a famous
  mathematician of Pelusium in Egypt, propounded the system that bears his
  name, viz., that the earth was the centre of the universe, and that the
  sun, moon, and planets revolved around it in the following order: nearest
  to the earth was the sphere of the moon; then followed the spheres of
  Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn; then came the sphere
  of the fixed stars; these were succeeded by two <i>crystalline</i>
  spheres and an outer sphere named the <i>primum mobile</i> or first
  movable, which last was again circumscribed by the <i>c&oelig;lum
  empyreum</i>, of a cubic shape, wherein happy souls found their abode.
  The Arabs began to make scientific astronomical observations about the
  middle of the eighth century, and for 400 years they prosecuted the
  science with assiduity. Ibn-Yunis (<span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1000)
  made important observations of the perturbations and eccentricities of
  Jupiter and Saturn. In the sixteenth century Nicolaus Copernicus, born in
  1473, introduced the system that bears his name, and which recognized the
  sun's central place in the solar system, and that all the other bodies,
  the earth included, revolve around it. This arrangement of the universe
  (see <i>Copernicus</i>) came at length to be generally received on
  account of the simplicity it substituted for the complexities and
  difficulties of the theory of Ptolemy. The observations and calculations
  of Tycho Brahe, a Danish astronomer, born in 1546, continued over many
  years, were of the highest value, and secured for him the title of
  regenerator of practical astronomy. His assistant and pupil, Kepler, born
  in 1571, was enabled, principally from the data provided by his master's
  labours, to arrive at those laws which have made his name famous: 1. That
  the planets move, not in circular, but in elliptical orbits, of which the
  sun occupies a focus. 2. That the radius vector, or imaginary straight
  line joining the sun and any planet, moves over equal <!-- Page 290
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page290"></a>[290]</span>spaces in
  equal times. 3. That the squares of the times of the revolutions of the
  planets are as the cubes of their mean distances from the sun. Galileo,
  who died in 1642, advanced the science by his observations and by the new
  revelations he made through his telescopes, which established the truth
  of the Copernican theory. Newton, born in 1642, carried physical
  astronomy suddenly to comparative perfection. Accepting Kepler's laws as
  a statement of the facts of planetary motion, he deduced from them his
  theory of gravitation. The science was enriched towards the close of the
  eighteenth century by the discovery by Herschel of the planet Uranus and
  its satellites, the resolution of the Milky Way into myriads of stars,
  and the investigation of nebulæ and of double and triple stars. The
  splendid analytical researches of Lalande, Lagrange, Delambre, and
  Laplace mark the same period. The nineteenth century opened with the
  discovery of the first four minor planets; and the existence of another
  planet (Neptune), more distant from the sun than Uranus, was, in 1845,
  independently predicted by Leverrier and Adams. Of late years the sun has
  attracted a number of observers, the spectroscope and photography having
  been especially fruitful in this field of investigation. By various
  methods the sun's mean distance has been ascertained within very small
  limits of error, and found to be nearly 93,000,000 miles. Many additions
  have been made to the known secondary planets or satellites, including
  some with retrograde motions. A vast number of asteroids has been
  discovered, and the width of the zone occupied by them found to be much
  more extensive. Much success has been achieved in ascertaining the
  parallax of fixed stars.</p>

  <p>The objects with which astronomy has chiefly to deal are the earth,
  the sun, the moon, the planets, the fixed stars, comets, nebulæ, and
  meteors. The stellar universe is composed of an unknown host of stars,
  many millions in number. Those visible to the naked eye were in ancient
  times grouped into the constellations still recognized. The nebulæ are
  cloud-like patches of light scattered all over the heavens. Some of them
  have been resolved into star-clusters, but many of them are masses of
  incandescent gas. Of the so-called fixed stars, many form binary or
  multiple systems, the members revolving in orbits under each other's
  attractions, while other more scattered groups are moving clusters,
  travelling in parallel paths through space like flocks of birds. Variable
  stars and extinct or dark stars are also known. The fixed stars preserve,
  at least to unaided vision, an unalterable relation to each other,
  because of their vast distance from the earth. Their apparent movement
  from east to west is the result of the earth's revolution on its axis in
  twenty-four hours from west to east. The planets have not only an
  apparent, but also a real and proper motion, since, like our earth, they
  revolve around the sun in their several orbits and periods. The nearest
  of these bodies to the sun is <i>Mercury</i>. <i>Venus</i>, the second
  planet from the sun, is to us the brightest and most beautiful of all the
  planets. The <i>Earth</i> is the first planet accompanied by a satellite
  or moon. <i>Mars</i>, the next planet, has two satellites, discovered in
  1877. Its surface has a variegated character, and the existence of land,
  water, snow, and ice has been inferred. The <i>Asteroids</i>, of which
  over 1000 are known, form a broad zone of small bodies, at distances from
  a little beyond the earth's to that of Jupiter. <i>Jupiter</i>, the
  largest planet, has at least nine satellites, of which the two outermost
  have retrograde motion. Its surface is diversified by spots, markings,
  and bands parallel to its equator. <i>Saturn</i>, with its nine or more
  satellites and broad thin rings in its equatorial plane, is, perhaps, the
  most striking telescopic object in the heavens.
  <i>Ur&#x103;nus</i>&mdash;discovered by Herschel in 1781&mdash;is
  accompanied by four satellites. <i>Neptune</i>, the farthest removed from
  the sun, has one satellite, the motion of which is retrograde. Besides
  the planets, quite a number of comets are known to be members of the
  solar system. The physical constitution of these bodies is still one of
  the enigmas of astronomy. The observation of meteors has recently
  attracted much attention. They are seen in largest numbers in the autumn
  months. Meteor streams are supposed to represent the results of the
  disintegration of comets. Among the more modern astronomers we may
  mention: Gustav Kirchhoff, G.&nbsp;B. Donati, Christian Doppler, H.&nbsp;C. Vogel,
  Sir William Huggins, Simon Newcomb, and Sir David Gill. See <i>Earth</i>,

  a great opponent) and of the incarnation, and contains what are known as
  the 'damnatory clauses', in which it declares that damnation must be the
  lot of those who do not believe the true and catholic faith. It is
  contained in the <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>, to be read on certain
  occasions.&mdash;<span class="scac">BIBLIOGRAPHY</span>: F.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;A. Hort,

  <p><b>Athana´sius, St.</b>, Archbishop of Alexandria, a renowned father
  of the Church, born in that city about <span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  296, died 373. While yet a young man he attended the Council at Nice
  (325), where he gained the highest esteem of the fathers by the talents
  which he displayed in the Arian controversy. He had a great share in the
  decrees passed here, and thereby drew on himself the hatred of the
  Arians. Shortly afterwards he was appointed Archbishop of Alexandria. The
  complaints and accusations of his enemies at length induced the Emperor
  Constantine to summon him in 334 before the Councils of Tyre and
  Jerusalem, when he was suspended, and <!-- Page 293 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page293"></a>[293]</span>afterwards banished to
  Trèves. The death of Constantine put an end to this banishment, and
  Constantius recalled the holy patriarch. His return to Alexandria
  resembled a triumph. Deposed again in 340, he was reinstated in 342.
  Again in 355 he was sentenced to be banished, when he retired into those
  parts of the desert which were entirely uninhabited. He was followed by a
  faithful servant, who, at the risk of his life, supplied him with the
  means of subsistence. Here Athanasius composed many writings, full of
  eloquence, to strengthen the faith of the believers, or expose the
  falsehood of his enemies. When Julian the Apostate ascended the throne,
  toleration was proclaimed to all religions, and Athanasius returned to
  his former position at Alexandria. His next controversy was with the
  heathen subjects of Julian, who excited the emperor against him, and he
  was obliged to flee in order to save his life. The death of the emperor
  and the accession of Jovian (363) again brought him back; but Valens
  becoming emperor, and the Arians recovering the superiority, he was once
  more compelled to flee. He concealed himself in the tomb of his father,
  where he remained four months, until Valens allowed him to return. From
  this period he remained undisturbed in his office till he died. Of the
  forty-six years of his official life he spent twenty in banishment, and
  the greater part of the remainder in defending the Nicene Creed.
  Athanasius was not so much a speculative theologian as a great Christian
  pastor (cf. L. Duchesne, <i>Histoire ancienne. de l'Église</i>, 1907).
  His writings, which are in Greek, are on polemical, historical, and moral
  subjects. The polemical treat chiefly of the doctrines of the Trinity,
  the incarnation of Christ, and the divinity of the Holy Spirit. The
  historical ones are of the greatest importance for the history of the
  Church. See <i>Athanasian Creed</i>.</p>

  <p><b>A´theism</b> (Gr. <i>a</i>, priv., and <i>Theos</i>, God), the
  disbelief of the existence of a God or supreme intelligent being; the
  doctrine opposed to <i>theism</i> or <i>deism</i>. The term has been
  often loosely used as equivalent with <i>infidelity</i> generally, with
  deism, with pantheism, and with the denial of immortality. The most
  famous exponents of atheism were La Mettrie, Holbach, Feuerbach, and Carl
  Vogt; whilst Comte and Haeckel have put forward systems of thought
  essentially atheistic.&mdash;<span class="scac">BIBLIOGRAPHY</span>: R.
  Flint, <i>Anti-theistic Theories</i>; J.&nbsp;S. Blackie, <i>Natural History

  <p><b>Ath´eling</b>, a title of honour among the Anglo-Saxons, meaning
  one who is of noble blood. The title was gradually confined to the
  princes of the blood royal, and in the ninth and tenth centuries was used
  exclusively for the sons or brothers of the reigning king.</p>

  <p><b>Atheling</b>, Edgar. See <i>Edgar Atheling</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Ath´elney</b>, formerly an island in the midst of fens and marshes,
  now drained and cultivated in Somersetshire, England, about 7 miles
  southeast of Bridgwater. Alfred the Great took refuge in it during a
  Danish invasion, and afterwards founded an abbey there.</p>

  <p><b>Ath´elstan</b>, King of England, born 895, died 941, succeeded his
  father, Edward the Elder, in 925. He was victorious in his wars with the
  Danes of Northumberland, and the Scots, by whom they were assisted. After
  a signal overthrow of his enemies at Brunanburgh he governed in peace and
  with great ability.</p>

  <p><b>Ath&#x113;´na</b>, or <b>Ath&#x113;n&#x113;</b>, a Greek goddess,
  identified by the Romans with Minerva, the representative of the
  intellectual powers; the daughter of Zeus (Jupiter) and M&#x113;tis (that
  is, wisdom or cleverness). According to the legend, before her birth Zeus
  swallowed her mother, and Athena afterwards sprang from the head of Zeus
  with a mighty war shout and in complete armour. In her character of a
  wise and prudent warrior she was contrasted with the fierce Ares (Mars).
  In the wars of the giants she slew Pallas and Enceladus. In the wars of
  the mortals she aided and protected heroes. She is also represented as
  the patroness of the arts of peace. The sculptor, the architect, and the
  painter, as well as the philosopher, the orator, and the poet, considered
  her their tutelar deity. She is also represented among the healing gods.
  In all these representations she is the symbol of the thinking faculty,
  the goddess of wisdom, science, and art; the latter, however, only in so
  far as invention and thought are comprehended. In the images of the
  goddess a manly gravity and an air of reflection are united with female
  beauty in her features. As a warrior she is represented completely armed,
  her head covered with a gold helmet. As the goddess of peaceful art she
  appears in the dress of a Grecian matron. To her insignia belong the
  Ægis, the Gorgon's head, the round Argive buckler; and the owl, the cock,
  the serpent, an olive branch, and a lance were sacred to her. All Attica,
  but particularly Athens, was sacred to her, and she had numerous temples
  there. Her most brilliant festival at Athens was the Panathenæa.</p>

  <p><b>Athenæ´um</b>, the temple of Athena or Minerva, at Athens,
  frequented by poets, learned men, and orators. The same name was given at
  Rome to the school which Hadrian established on the Capitoline Mount for
  the promotion of literary and scientific studies. In modern times the
  same name is given to literary clubs and establishments connected with
  the sciences. It is also the title of several literary periodicals.</p>

  <p><b>Athenæ´us</b>, a Greek rhetorician and grammarian, who lived at the
  end of the second and <!-- Page 294 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page294"></a>[294]</span>beginning of the third century after
  Christ, author of an encyclopædic work, in the form of conversation,
  called <i>The Professors at the Dinner-table</i> (<i>Deipnosophistæ</i>),
  which is a rich but ill-arranged treasure of historical, antiquarian,
  philosophical, grammatical, &amp;c., knowledge.</p>

  <p><b>Athenag´oras</b>, a Platonic philosopher of Athens, a convert to
  Christianity, who wrote a Greek <i>Apology for the Christians</i>,
  addressed to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, in 177, one of the earliest
  that appeared.</p>

  <p><b>Ath´ens</b> (Gr. <i>Ath&#x113;nai</i>, Lat. <i>Ath&#x113;næ</i>),
  anciently the capital of Attica and centre of Greek culture, now the
  capital of the kingdom of Greece. It is situated in the central plain of
  Attica, about 4 miles from the Saronic Gulf or Gulf of Ægina, an arm of
  the Ægean Sea running in between the mainland and the Peloponnesus. It is
  said to have been founded about 1550 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> by
  Cecrops, the mythical Pelasgian hero, and to have borne the name Cecropia
  until under Erechtheus it received the name of Athens in honour of
  Ath&#x113;n&#x113;. The Acropolis, an irregular oval crag 150 feet high,
  with a level summit 1000 feet long by 500 in breadth, was the original
  nucleus of the city, which, according to tradition, was extended by
  Theseus when Athens became the head of the confederate Attic States. The
  three chief eminences near the Acropolis&mdash;the Areopagus to the
  north-west, the Pnyx to the south-west, and the Museum to the south of
  the Pnyx&mdash;were thus included within the city boundary as the sites
  of its chief public buildings, the city itself, however, afterwards
  taking a northerly direction. On the east ran the Ilissus and on the west
  the Cephissus, while to the south-west lay three harbours&mdash;Phalerum,
  the oldest and nearest; the Piræus, the most important; and Munychia, the
  Piræan Acropolis. At the height of its prosperity the city was connected
  with its harbours by three massive walls (the 'long walls'). The
  architectural development of Athens may be dated from the rule of the
  Pisistratids (560-510 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), who are credited
  with the foundation of the huge temple of the Olympian Zeus, completed by
  Hadrian seven centuries later, the erection of the Pythium or temple of
  the Pythian Apollo, and of the Lyceum or temple of Apollo
  Lyceus&mdash;all near the Ilissus; and to whom were due the enclosure of
  the Academy, a gymnasium and gardens to the north of the city, and the
  building of the Agora with its Portico or Stoa, Bouleuterium or
  Senate-house, Tholus, and Prytaneum. With the foundation of Athenian
  democracy under Clisthenes, the Pnyx or place of public assembly, with
  its semicircular area and cyclopean wall, first became of importance, and
  a commencement was made of the Dionysiac theatre (theatre of Dionysus or
  Bacchus) on the south side of the Acropolis. After the destruction
  wrought by the Persians in 480 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>,
  Themistocles reconstructed the city upon practical lines and with a
  larger area, enclosing the city in new walls 7½ miles in circumference,
  erecting the north wall of the Acropolis, and developing the maritime
  resources of the Piræus; while Cimon added to the southern fortifications
  of the Acropolis, placed on it the temple of Wingless Victory, planted
  the Agora with trees, laid out the Academy, and built the Theseum on an
  eminence north of the Areopagus; his brother-in-law, Peisianax, erected
  the famous Stoa Poecil&#x113;, a hall with walls covered with paintings
  (whence the <i>Stoics</i> got their name). Under Pericles the highest
  point of artistic development was reached. An Odeum was erected on the
  east of the Dionysiac theatre for the recitations of rhapsodists and
  musicians; and with the aid of the architects Ict&#x12B;nus, Callicrates,
  and Mnesicles, and of the sculptor Phidias, the Acropolis was perfected.
  Covering the whole of the western end rose the Propylæa, the splendid
  structure through which the Acropolis was entered, constructed of
  Pentelic marble and consisting of a central gateway portico with two
  wings in the form of Doric temples. Just outside the Propylæa was the
  small temple of Wingless Victory. A short distance within the entrance
  stood the bronze statue of Athena Promachus, a colossal work of Phidias,
  66 feet high, showing the goddess in complete armour and leaning on a
  lance. Beyond it to the left was the Erechtheum, the shrine of Athena
  Polias, guardian of the city, containing a very ancient and sacred statue
  of Athena in olive-wood; while to the right, on the highest part of the
  Acropolis, was the marble Parthenon or temple of Athena, the crowning
  glory of the whole. This renowned structure, still glorious in its ruins,
  was built under the auspices of Pericles, Phidias being the sculptor and
  artistic adviser, and Ict&#x12B;nus and Callicrates the architects. It is
  in the Doric style, and among its numerous sculptures were fifty
  life-size statues, while in the interior was a chryselephantine (gold and
  ivory) figure of the goddess, 39 feet high. (See <i>Parthenon</i>.) Minor
  statues and shrines occupied the rest of the area of the Acropolis, which
  was for the time wholly appropriated to the worship of the guardian
  deities of the city. The Acropolis museum, a building of recent date,
  contains an interesting and valuable collection of works of art found
  here. In the interval between the close of the Peloponnesian War and the
  battle of Chæronea few additions were made to the city. But the long
  walls and Piræus, destroyed by Lysander, were restored by Conon, and
  under the orator Lycurgus the Dionysiac temple was completed, the
  Panathenaic stadium commenced, and the choragic monuments of Lysicrates
  and Thrasyllus <!-- Page 295 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page295"></a>[295]</span>erected. Later on Ptolemy Philadelphus
  gave Athens the Ptolemæum near the Theseum, Attalus I the stoa north-east
  of the Agora, Eumenes II that near the great theatre, and Antiochus
  Epiphanes carried on the Olympieum. Under the Romans it continued a
  flourishing city, Hadrian in the second century adorning it with many new
  buildings, and constructing an aqueduct, finished by his son Antoninus
  Pius. At this time also a wealthy citizen, Herodes Atticus, did much to
  beautify the city, and in particular constructed an Odeum, the ruins of
  which are still conspicuous. Indeed Athens was at no time more splendid
  than under the Antonines, when Pausanias visited and described it. But
  after a time Christian zeal, the attacks of barbarians, and robberies of
  collectors made sad inroads among the monuments. About <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 420 paganism was totally annihilated at Athens,
  and when Justinian closed even the schools of the philosophers, the
  reverence for buildings associated with the names of the ancient deities
  and heroes was lost. The Parthenon was turned into a church of the Virgin
  Mary, and St. George stepped into the place of Theseus. Finally, in 1456,
  the place fell into the hands of the Turks. The Parthenon became a
  mosque, and in 1687 was greatly damaged by an explosion at the siege of
  Athens by the Venetians. Enough, however, remains of it and of the
  neighbouring structures to attest the splendour of the Acropolis; while
  of the other buildings of the city, the Theseum, or temple of Theseus,
  and the Horologium, or temple of the Winds, are admirably preserved, as
  are also structures belonging to the Pnyx, Panathenaic stadium (restored
  and again used for games), &amp;c. The Theseum, indeed, is said to be the
  best preserved building of all ancient Greece, and is hardly less
  imposing than the Parthenon. Of more than a hundred columns that belonged
  to the Olympieum or temple of the Olympian Zeus, completed by Hadrian,
  only fifteen are still standing. Soon after the commencement of the war
  of liberation in 1821 the Turks surrendered Athens, but captured it again
  in 1826-7. The Great Powers now intervened to bring about the
  independence of Greece. The Turks evacuated Athens in 1833, and the
  troops of King Otho then entered the city. In 1835 it became the royal
  residence, and it soon began to make rapid progress, though its natural
  position is by no means advantageous. The modern city mostly lies north,
  north-east, and north-west of the Acropolis, and consists mainly of
  straight and well-built streets. Among the principal buildings are the
  royal palace, a stately building with a façade of Pentelic marble
  (completed 1843), the university, the academy of science, national museum
  of archaeology, public library, exhibition building, polytechnic
  institute, theatre, and observatory. There are two universities, the
  National University, opened in 1836, and the Capodistrian University with
  3250 students. There are valuable museums, in particular the National
  Museum and that in the Polytechnic School, which contains the Schliemann
  collection, &amp;c. These are constantly being added to by excavations.
  There are four foreign archæological schools or institutes, the French,
  German, American, and British. The Zappeion or exhibition building is a
  handsome structure, erected at the expense of the brothers Zappas to
  exhibit Greek industries. Tramways have been made in the principal
  streets, and the city is connected by tramway and railway (6 miles) with
  its port, the Piræus. Athens has also railway connection with the north
  and west of the kingdom as well as with the Peloponnesus. The Piræus is
  the chief Greek centre of trade and industry. Water is brought from Mount
  Pentelicus on the north-east, the aqueduct begun by Hadrian being
  utilized in supplying the city. Pop. 167,479, and including the Piræus
  241,058.&mdash;<span class="scac">BIBLIOGRAPHY</span>: E.&nbsp;A. Gardner,

  <p><b>Athletes</b> (ath´l&#x113;ts; Gr. <i>athl&#x113;tai</i>, from
  <i>athlos</i>, a contest, <i>athlon</i>, a prize), originally, in ancient
  <!-- Page 296 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page296"></a>[296]</span>Greece, combatants who took part and
  contended for a prize (<i>athlon</i>) in the public games. The profession
  was an honourable one; tests of birth, position, and character were
  imposed, and crowns, statues, special privileges, and pensions were among
  the rewards of success. (See <i>Games</i>.) The word is used in a similar
  sense at the present day, but is more especially applied to persons who
  can exhibit feats of strength. Games and athletic competitions, if they
  do not hold such an honourable position to-day as they did in antiquity,
  are still practised with great enthusiasm and excite the keenest interest
  in their patrons.</p>

  <p><b>Athletic Sports</b>, a general name for certain physical exercises
  demanding a special natural ability, and embodying a variety of events
  which conventionally include not only running and jumping but such feats
  of strength as putting the weight and throwing the hammer. The selection
  of these events at any athletic meeting is a somewhat arbitrary one, and
  the inclusion of those which require strength and skill rather than speed
  and agility rests more on a traditional than a logical basis. A
  particular feature which distinguishes these exercises as athletic sports
  is the presence of the idea of competition; thus running and walking, as
  isolated exercises, can be called 'sports' only when men compete against
  one another, although the factor of competition may be only indirectly
  present, as when an athlete endeavours to beat a record.</p>

  <p>In this country athletic sports have long been a national
  characteristic, and records, more or less authentic, have been handed
  down for the last hundred years or more. Until comparatively recently,
  such sports have been the prerogative of the British Isles; but during
  the last thirty years the United States have adopted them with enormous
  enthusiasm and success, and more recently still the vogue has extended
  throughout the Continent, and good results have been obtained by
  representatives from France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Sweden, and
  Finland, as well as from all the Colonies. In this country no school, no
  matter how small or how humble its pretensions, fails to hold its
  athletic meeting annually. The same applies to all colleges of the
  leading universities, Oxford and Cambridge, the best representatives of
  which compete against one another, whilst the smaller universities hold
  similar competitions. In addition, a large number of clubs are in
  existence throughout the country for the promotion and encouragement of
  sports, the whole system of athletics being under the Amateur Athletic
  Association (founded in 1880), whose rules and regulations for the
  correct maintenance of athletics in the best interests of amateurism are
  regarded as a standard throughout the world. Under its auspices an annual
  meeting&mdash;the Amateur Championships&mdash;is held. This meeting is
  open to the whole world, and many of the championships have been held at
  one time or another by distinguished visitors from America, the Colonies,
  and the Continent. At the time of writing, the association is considering
  the project of holding two distinct annual meetings, one of which shall,
  as hitherto, be unrestricted, the other confined to residents in the
  British Isles. This, which is the most important meeting of the year, has
  taken place uninterruptedly since its origin in 1866 with the exception
  of the military interval, 1915-8, and has been successfully resumed in
  1919. For the past fourteen or fifteen years the meeting has been held in
  London on the first Saturday in July, and this practice will probably be
  a permanent one, although hitherto the venue was, in rotation, London,
  the Midlands, and the North. The university and inter-university meetings
  are held before Easter, the former at the respective university towns,
  the latter at Queen's Club, London. Among other important representative
  contests may be mentioned the Public Schools' Championships (usually in
  April), the United Hospitals' Championships, the Irish, the Scottish, the
  Welsh, the Midland and the Northern Counties' Championships. During the
  war, athletics were practically restricted to the services, and the Army
  Athletic Championships, held in Aug., 1919, was a successful reunion of
  soldier athletes from the various theatres of war, and included, for the
  first time in history, coloured troops.</p>

  <p>The standard inter-university meeting comprises ten events, namely,
  flat races&mdash;100 yards, ¼ mile, ½ mile, 1 mile, and 3 miles;
  120-yards hurdle race; the high jump and long jump; putting the weight
  and throwing the hammer. These events appear in the programme of the
  Amateur Championship meeting, with the substitution of a 4-miles race for
  the 3 miles, and the addition of a 220-yards race, a 2-miles walking
  race, a 2-miles steeplechase (representing a miniature cross-country
  event), and the pole jump. A relay race, in which four representatives
  from each club run half a mile, a quarter of a mile, 220 yards, and 220
  yards respectively, is also included as a standard event; whilst at the
  1919 meeting a race of 440 yards over hurdles appeared for the first
  time, and will probably occupy a permanent place in the programme. Two
  additional Amateur Championship events, 7-miles walk and 10-miles flat
  race, are usually held at a separate meeting in the spring.</p>

  <p>In addition to the preceding British meetings, a great International
  contest, the Olympic Games, is held every four years in a country
  selected by the Olympic committee. This meeting is truly international,
  the last before 1914 <!-- Page 297 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page297"></a>[297]</span>having taken place at Stockholm in 1912,
  when representatives from the most distant parts of the world competed
  with representatives from every country in Europe in a remarkably
  elaborate programme, which included, in addition to the preceding, such
  feats as throwing the javelin and the discus, and the classic 'Marathon
  race' over the traditional distance of 26¼ miles. The 1920 Olympic
  meeting was arranged to take place at Antwerp.</p>

  <p>Although many excellently arranged athletic sports are held
  successfully upon a grass course, at any important meeting the races are
  contested upon a properly-constructed cinder-path, a quarter or a third
  of a mile in length, and in shape an oval flattened on two sides so as to
  include as much straight as possible. The width of the running path is
  variable, but 18 to 24 feet may be regarded as an average. The centre is
  of grass, and spaces are prepared for the hurdle race, for the jumps, and
  the other events which are described as the <i>field</i>, as opposed to
  <i>track</i>, events.</p>

  <p>Flat races are classified as 'sprint races', 'middle distance' and
  'long distance' races, although the distinction between these is somewhat
  arbitrary. Whether or no a man is actually capable of running the whole
  distance in question at full speed, the term 'sprint' is applied to those
  distances in which an attempt is made to put forth a continuous maximum
  effort. The limit is, by general consent, fixed at 300 yards. At any good
  meeting the 100-yards race will be run in 10 seconds; at the very best
  meeting this time will be beaten; and many runners have been credited
  with 9<sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub> seconds, a few, under exceptional
  conditions, with 9<sup>3</sup>/<sub>5</sub> seconds. The record for 220
  yards is 21<sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub> seconds. Middle-distance running
  includes races from a quarter mile to a mile, and races are held at 440
  yards, 600 yards, 880 yards, 1000 yards, 1 mile, and very occasionally at
  ¾ mile. With modern specialization, however, it is rare to find any one
  runner capable of supremacy at more than one of these distances. The ¼
  mile is the common ground for the sprinter and the middle-distance
  runner, and 48 seconds has been beaten on several occasions, although it
  may be said that anything inside 50 seconds is a first-class performance.
  The record for 600 yards is 1 minute 11 seconds. The ½-mile race has
  demonstrated latterly, perhaps, the greatest advance of all; and whilst
  anything under 2 minutes may still be regarded as a good performance, a
  championship event will most always be won in 3 or 4 seconds faster time;
  whilst at an Olympic meeting the wonderful record of 1 minute 52½ seconds
  has been made. The mile, which was originally regarded as a long-distance
  event, is now legitimately considered as within the capacity of a
  middle-distance runner. At any first-class meeting 4 minutes 20 seconds
  will be accomplished, and any diminution of this time may be regarded as
  of superlative merit. The record, which has stood since 1886, is 4
  minutes 12¾ seconds, although a recent performance in America, which is a
  tiny fraction of a second faster, has yet to be passed. Over 1 mile,
  long-distance running begins, and, as considerable staying-power is
  required, it is not unusual to find one man prove champion at 4 miles and
  10 miles, and even the 1-mile race in the same year. No runner has yet
  achieved the capacity of running 12 miles within the hour, although two
  or three have been within a few hundred yards of this distance. About ten
  years ago the fashion became a craze of contesting 'Marathon races' in
  which all sorts of distances, quite independent of the classic 26¼ miles,
  were employed. At rare intervals very long-distance running, such as 50
  miles, is indulged in. For any distance over 20 miles a special form of
  endurance is called for, rather than orthodox running in good style. As a
  competition 'walking' is an unsatisfactory exercise, because of the
  extreme difficulty in deciding when the athlete is still fulfilling the
  orthodox regulation as to what constitutes fair 'heel and toe', inasmuch
  as the style of a man who is ostensibly walking, yet actually progressing
  at a rate faster than 9 miles an hour (faster than the average untrained
  person can run), is exceedingly difficult to analyse. About fifteen years
  ago long-distance walking became exceedingly popular, and hundreds of
  competitors attempted the classic walk to Brighton and back.</p>

  <p>The usual hurdle race is over 120 yards, with ten flights of hurdles
  10 yards apart, so that a distance of 15 yards separates the start from
  the first flight, and the same distance the last flight from the finish.
  The hurdles are 3½ feet high, with perfectly-level top rails. In correct
  'hurdling' the 'three-stride method' is essential, that is to say, three
  strides are taken on the flat between the hurdles, and the athlete rises
  6 feet from the obstacle, taking it in his stride, so that retardation of
  speed is reduced to a minimum. The skill and accuracy of an accomplished
  hurdler is remarkable, and the race is frequently run inside 16 seconds;
  a record of 15 seconds, and even a trifle less, has been
  accomplished.</p>

  <p>In this country, running long jump and high jump (and to a less extent
  the pole jump) alone are practised to any extent, although as occasional
  events the standing high and long jumps are contested, and, still less
  frequently, the old-fashioned hop, step, and jump. In the long jump the
  athlete employs all the impetus he can acquire by a sprint of about 30
  yards. The ideal aimed at is to run at the fastest speed which is <!--
  Page 298 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page298"></a>[298]</span>consistent with reaching the taking-off
  board with accuracy, and then to leap as high as possible. A fraction of
  an inch under 25 feet has been cleared on two occasions, although it may
  be said that anything over 24 feet is exceptional, and that any jumper
  capable of 23 feet consistently has a good chance to win an Amateur
  Championship. The high jump requires skill of a very peculiar character.
  Whilst the novice regards this feat as dependent on momentum, and takes a
  correspondingly long run to acquire speed, the crack performer employs
  his capacity of manipulating his body and limbs so as to cross the bar in
  a horizontal position. In this way the prodigious height of 6 feet 7
  inches has been cleared. In general it may be said that first-class
  jumping begins at 6 feet.</p>

  <p>Pole jumping, a particularly pretty event to watch, has never been
  practised to any great extent in this country, and, in fact, does not
  even appear to be so popular here as twenty years ago. The pole employed
  is of light but strong bamboo about 14 feet long, with a sharp ferrule at
  one end, which is stuck firmly into the ground. By the help of the pole,
  which is firmly grasped near the other end, the jumper elevates himself
  to the bar, over which he throws his legs and his body, finally
  relinquishing his hold of the pole, to fall on the opposite side. Recent
  years have witnessed the development of great skill in this event,
  particularly by the Americans, Canadians, and Swedes, and 13 feet has
  been cleared.</p>

  <p>The weight or shot is an iron ball weighing 16 lb., which must be put
  with one hand only from the shoulder within a circle of 7 feet diameter.
  Although great strength is essential, skill in utilizing the whole of the
  body plays a very important part. Over 50 feet has been put on several
  occasions.</p>

  <p>The 'hammer' is a ball of lead or iron attached by a wire to a handle.
  The total length must not exceed four feet; the weight of the whole must
  be at least 16 lb. The performer grasps the handle with one or both
  hands, and, standing within a 7-foot circle, swings the ball round and
  round to acquire impetus, which is then increased by rapid rotatory
  movements of his body. Once again skill and co-ordination must be wedded
  to strength. A crack performer has thrown over 175 feet.</p>

  <p>Throwing the javelin and discus are classical rather than popular
  events, and their cultivation is fashionable only when an Olympic contest
  is imminent. Among other 'strong-men' contests, which have long been
  favourite sports in Scotland, are tossing the <i>caber</i> and putting
  the stone. The latter is usually a very heavy implement weighing about 56
  lb.; the 'caber' is the trunk of a fir or other tree, freed from
  branches, which is held upright close to the chest by the smaller end,
  and thrown so as to alight on the heavier end.&mdash;<span

  temple was at Denderah. From her the third month of the Egyptian year
  derived its name.</p>

  <p><b>A´thos</b> (now <b>Hagion Oros</b> or <b>Monte Santo</b>, that is,
  Holy Mountain), a mountain 6700 feet high, terminating the most eastern
  of the three peninsulas of Macedonia that jut in parallel directions into
  the Archipelago. The name, however, is frequently applied to the whole
  peninsula, which is about 30 miles long by 5 broad. It is covered with
  forests, and plantations of olive, vine, and other fruit-trees. Both the
  surface and coast-line are irregular. The Persian fleet under Mardonius
  was wrecked here in 493 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, and to avoid a
  similar calamity Xerxes caused a canal, of which traces may yet be seen,
  to be cut through the isthmus that joins the peninsula to the mainland.
  On the peninsula there are situated about twenty monasteries and a
  multitude of hermitages, which contain from 6000 to 8000 monks and
  hermits of the order of St. Basil. The libraries of the monasteries are
  rich in literary treasures and manuscripts. Every nation belonging to the
  Greek Church has here one or more monasteries of its own, which are
  annually visited by pilgrims. After having passed in the fifteenth
  century from the sovereignty of the Greek Emperors of Byzantium to that
  of the Sultans, it fell again into the hands of the Greeks, who occupied
  it in Nov., 1912. Each of the twenty monasteries is a little republic in
  itself, and until 1912 they used to pay an annual tribute of nearly £4000
  to the Turks, and were governed by a synod of twenty monastic deputies
  and four presidents meeting weekly. They are now ruled either by abbots
  chosen for life, or by a board of overseers elected for a certain number
  of years. The revenue of the community is derived from <!-- Page 299

  <p><b>Atlantic City</b>, a fashionable watering-place of the United
  States, on the coast of New Jersey. It is an important air port, and has
  an aerodrome covering about 160 acres. Pop. 50,682.</p>

  <p><b>Atlantic Ocean</b>, the vast expanse of sea lying between the west
  coasts of Europe and Africa and the east coasts of North and South
  America, and extending from the Arctic to the Antarctic Ocean; greatest
  breadth, between the west coast of Northern Africa and the east coast of
  Florida, 4150 miles; least breadth, between Norway and Greenland, 930
  miles. The total area of the North Atlantic (including the inland seas)
  is 13,262,000 sq. miles; the area of the South Atlantic is 12,627,000 sq.
  miles. The principal inlets and bays are Baffin's and Hudson's Bays, the
  Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, the North Sea, the Bay of Biscay, and
  the Gulf of Guinea. The principal islands north of the equator are
  Iceland, the Faroe and British Islands, the Azores, Canaries, and Cape
  Verde Islands, Newfoundland, Cape Breton, and the West India Islands; and
  south of the equator, Ascension, St. Helena, and Tristan da Cunha.</p>

  <p>The great currents of the Atlantic are the Equatorial Current
  (divisible into the Main, Northern, and Southern Equatorial Currents),
  the Gulf Stream, the North African and Guinea Current, the Southern
  Connecting Current, the Southern Atlantic Current, the Cape Horn Current,
  Rennel's Current, and the Arctic Current. The current system is primarily
  set in motion by the trade-winds which drive the water of the
  intertropical region from Africa towards the American coasts. The Main
  Equatorial Current, passing across the Atlantic, is turned by the S.
  American coast, along which it runs at a rate of 30 to 50 miles a day,
  till, having received part of the North Equatorial Current, it enters the
  Gulf of Mexico. Issuing thence between Florida and Cuba under the name of
  the Gulf Stream, it flows with a gradually-expanding channel nearly
  parallel to the coast of the United States. It then turns north-eastward
  into the mid-Atlantic, the larger proportion of it passing southward to
  the east of the Azores to swell the North African and Guinea Current
  created by the northerly winds off the Portuguese coast. The Guinea
  Current, which takes a southerly course, is divided into two on arriving
  at the region of the north-east trades, part of it flowing east to the
  Bight of Biafra and joining the South African feeder of the Main
  Equatorial, but the larger portion being carried westward into the North
  Equatorial drift. Rennel's Current, which is possibly a continuation of
  the Gulf Stream, enters the Bay of Biscay from the west, curves round its
  coast, and then turns north-west towards Cape Clear. The Arctic Current
  runs along the east coast of Greenland (being here called the Greenland
  Current), doubles Cape Farewell, and flows up towards Davis' Strait; it
  then turns to the south along the coasts of Labrador and the United
  States, from which it separates the Gulf Stream by a cold band of water.
  Immense masses of ice are borne south by this current from the Polar
  seas. In the interior of the North Atlantic there is a large area
  comparatively free from currents, called the Sargasso Sea, from the large
  quantity of sea-weed (of the genus Sargassum) which drifts into it. A
  similar area exists in the South Atlantic. In the South Atlantic the
  portion of the Equatorial Current which strikes the American coast below
  Cape St. Roque flows southward at the rate of from 12 to 20 miles a day
  along the Brazil coast under the name of the Brazil Current. It then
  turns eastward and forms the South Connecting Current, which, on reaching
  the South African coast, turns northward into the Main and Southern
  Equatorial Currents. Besides the surface currents, an under current of
  cold water flows from the poles to the equator, and an upper current of
  warm water from the equator towards the poles.</p>

  <p>The greatest depth as yet discovered is north of Porto Rico, in the
  West Indies, namely 27,360 feet. Cross-sections of the North Atlantic
  between Europe and America show that its bed consists of two great
  valleys lying in a north-and-south direction, and separated by a ridge,
  on which there is an average depth of 1800 fathoms. <!-- Page 300
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page300"></a>[300]</span>The mean depth
  of the North Atlantic is 2047 fathoms, that of the South Atlantic 2067
  fathoms. A ridge, called the <i>Wyville-Thomson Ridge</i>, with a depth
  of little more than 200 fathoms above it, runs from near the Butt of
  Lewis to Iceland, cutting off the colder water of the Arctic Ocean from
  the warmer water of the Atlantic. The South Atlantic, of which the
  greatest depth yet found is over 3000 fathoms, resembles the North
  Atlantic in having an elevated plateau or ridge in the centre with a deep
  trough on either side. The saltness and specific gravity of the Atlantic
  gradually diminish from the tropics to the poles, and also from within a
  short distance of the tropics to the equator. In the neighbourhood of the
  British Isles the salt has been stated at one thirty-eighth of the weight
  of the water. The North Atlantic is the greatest highway of ocean traffic
  in the world. It is also a great area of submarine communication, by
  means of the telegraphic cables that are laid across its bed. See

  Atlantic over against the Pillars of Hercules (Straits of Gibraltar), was
  the home of a great nation, and was finally swallowed up by the sea. The

  <p><b>Atlas</b>, an extensive mountain system in North Africa, starting
  near Cape Nun on the Atlantic Ocean, traversing Morocco, Algiers, and
  Tunis, and terminating on the coast of the Mediterranean; divided
  generally into two parallel ranges, running <span class="scac">W.</span>
  to <span class="scac">E.</span>, the Greater Atlas lying towards the
  Sahara and the Lesser Atlas towards the Mediterranean. The principal
  chain is about 1500 miles long, and the principal peaks rise above or
  approach the line of perpetual congelation, Miltsin in Morocco being
  11,400 feet high, and Tizi Likumpt being 13,150. The highest elevation is
  perhaps Tizi Tamyurt, estimated at fully 15,000 feet. Silver, antimony,
  lead, copper, iron, &amp;c., are among the minerals. The vegetation is
  chiefly European in character, except on the low grounds and next the
  desert.</p>

  <p><b>Atlas</b>, in Greek mythology, the name of a Titan whom Zeus
  condemned to bear the vault of heaven.&mdash;The same name is given to a
  collection of maps and charts, and was first used by Gerard Mercator in
  the sixteenth century, the figure of Atlas bearing the globe being given
  on the title-pages of such works.</p>

  <p><b>Atlas</b>, in anatomy, is the name of the first vertebra of the
  neck, which supports the head. It is connected with the occipital bone in
  such a way as to permit of the nodding movement of the head, and rests on
  the second vertebra or <i>axis</i>, their union allowing the head to turn
  from side to side.</p>

  <p><b>At´las</b>, a kind of silk or silk-satin fabric of Eastern
  manufacture.</p>

  <p><b>Atmidom´eter</b>, an instrument for measuring the evaporation from
  water, ice, or snow. It somewhat resembles Nicholson's hydrometer, being
  constructed so as to float in water and having an upright graduated stem,
  on the top of which is a metal pan. Water, ice, or snow is put into the
  pan, so as to sink the zero of the stem to a level with the cover of the
  vessel, and as evaporation goes on the stem rises, showing the amount of
  evaporation in grains.</p>

  <p><b>Atmom´eter</b>, an instrument for measuring the amount of
  evaporation from a moist surface in a given time. It is often a thin
  hollow ball of porous earthenware in which is inserted a graduated glass
  tube. The cavity of the ball and tube being filled with water and the top
  of the tube closed, the instrument is exposed to the free action of the
  air; the relative rapidity with which the water transuding through the
  porous substance is evaporated is marked by the scale on the tube as the
  water sinks.</p>

  <p><b>At´mosphere</b>, primarily the gaseous envelope which surrounds the
  earth; but the term is applied to that of any orb. Twilight effects show
  that the atmosphere is sufficiently dense up to a height of 40 miles to
  scatter or reflect to an appreciable degree the sun's rays, while the
  phenomena of meteors, which are rendered luminous through friction, show
  that it extends, though in extremely attenuated form, to 100 or even 200
  or more miles. It exerts on every part of the earth's surface a pressure
  of about 15 (14.73) lb. per sq. inch. The existence of this atmospheric
  pressure was first proved by Torricelli, who thus accounted for the rush
  of a liquid to fill a vacuum, and who, working out the idea, produced the
  first barometer. The average height of the mercurial column
  counterbalancing the atmospheric weight at the sea-level is a little less
  than 30 inches; but the pressure varies from hour to hour, and, roughly
  speaking, diminishes in geometrical progression with arithmetical
  increase in altitude. Of periodic variations there are two maxima of
  daily pressure, occurring when the temperature is about the mean of the
  day, and two minima, when it is at its highest and lowest respectively;
  but the problems of diurnal and seasonal oscillations have yet to be
  fully solved. The pressure <!-- Page 301 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page301"></a>[301]</span>upon the human body of average size is no
  less than 14 tons, but as it is exerted equally in all directions no
  inconvenience is caused by it. It is sometimes convenient to take the
  atmospheric pressure as a standard for measuring other fluid pressures;
  thus the steam pressure of 30 lb. per sq. inch on a boiler is spoken of
  as a pressure of two atmospheres.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere, first subjected to analysis by Priestley and Scheele
  in the latter part of the eighteenth century, consists practically of
  oxygen and nitrogen in the almost constant proportion of 20.81 volumes of
  oxygen to 79.19 volumes of nitrogen, or, by weight, 23.01 parts of oxygen
  to 76.99 of nitrogen. The gases are associated together, not as a
  chemical compound, but as a mechanical mixture. Upon the oxygen present
  depends the power of the atmosphere to support combustion and
  respiration, the nitrogen acting as a diluent to prevent its too
  energetic action. It had long been known that atmospheric nitrogen
  appeared to have a very slightly greater density than nitrogen obtained
  from other sources. Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay found that the
  fact was due to a still more inert gas which forms nearly 1 per cent of
  the air, and which had not previously been separated from nitrogen. This
  has been named <i>argon</i>. Besides these gases, the atmosphere also
  contains aqueous vapour in variable quantity, ozone, carbonic acid gas,
  traces of ammonia, nitric acid, and, in towns, sulphuretted hydrogen and
  sulphurous acid gas. In addition to its gaseous constituents the
  atmosphere is charged with dust, bacteria, &amp;c. For other gases which
  are present in traces, see <i>Neon</i>. See <i>Climate</i>;

  <p><b>Atmospheric Engine</b>, name given by early inventors to engines in
  which the piston is restored to the bottom of its stroke by atmospheric
  pressure.</p>

  <p><b>Atmospheric Railway</b>, so called in consequence of the motive
  power being derived from the pressure of the atmosphere, or from
  compressed air. The idea of thus obtaining motion was first suggested by
  the French engineer Papin, about 200 years ago. In 1810, and again in
  1827, Medhurst published a scheme for 'propelling carriages through a
  close-fitting air-tight tunnel by forcing in air behind them'; and in
  1825 a similar project was patented by Vallance of Brighton. About 1835
  H. Pinkus, an American residing in England, patented a pneumatic railway.
  The carriages were to travel on an open line of rails, along which a
  cast-iron tube of between 3 and 4 feet diameter was to be laid, having a
  longitudinal slit from 1 to 2 inches wide and closed by a flexible valve
  along its upper side, through which a connection could be formed between
  the leading carriage and a piston working within the tube. This method
  was improved by Messrs. Clegg &amp; Samuda, who in 1840 tried some
  experiments on a portion of the West London Railway with sufficient
  success to induce the Government to advance a loan to the Dublin and
  Kingstown Railway Company, for the construction of a pneumatic line from
  Kingstown to Dalkey. It was opened for passenger traffic at the end of
  1843, and was worked for many months. The London and Croydon Company
  subsequently obtained powers for laying down an atmospheric railway by
  the side of their other line from London to Croydon, and in experimental
  trips in 1845 a speed of 30 miles an hour was obtained with sixteen
  carriages, and of 70 miles with six carriages. But during the intense
  heat of the summer of 1846 the iron tube frequently became so hot as to
  melt the composition which sealed the valve, and the line had to be
  worked by locomotives. The mechanical difficulty of commanding a
  sufficient amount of rarefaction led to the abandonment of the system for
  railway purposes. It has been revived, however, for the conveyance of
  letters and parcels in towns by means of tubes of moderate diameter laid
  beneath the streets. See <i>Pneumatic Dispatch</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Atoll´</b>, the Polynesian name for coral islands of the ringed
  type enclosing a lagoon in the centre. They are found chiefly in the
  Pacific in archipelagos, and occasionally are of large size. Suadiva
  Atoll is 44 miles by 34; Rimsky 54 by 20. See <i>Coral</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Atomic Theory</b>, a theory as to the existence and properties of
  atoms (see <i>Atoms</i>); especially, in chemistry, the theory accounting
  for the fact that in compound bodies the elements combine in certain
  constant proportions, by assuming that all bodies are composed of
  ultimate atoms, the weight of which is different in different kinds of
  matter. It is associated with the name of Dalton, who systematized and
  extended the imperfect results of his predecessors. On its practical side
  the atomic theory asserts three <i>Laws of Combining Proportions</i>: (1)
  The Law of Constant or Definite Proportions, teaching that in every
  chemical compound the nature and relative weights of the constituent
  elements are definite and invariable; thus water invariably consists of 8
  parts by weight of oxygen to 1 part by weight of hydrogen; (2) The Law of
  Multiple Proportions, according to which the several proportions in which
  one element unites with a given weight of another invariably bear towards
  each other a simple relation; thus 1 part by weight of hydrogen unites
  with 8 parts by weight of oxygen to form water, and with 16 (i.e. 8×2)
  parts of oxygen to form peroxide of hydrogen; (3) The Law of Combination
  <!-- Page 302 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page302"></a>[302]</span>in Reciprocal Proportions, that the
  proportions in which two elements combine with a third also represent the
  proportions in which, or in some simple multiple of which, they will
  themselves combine; thus in olefiant gas hydrogen is present with carbon
  in the proportion of 1 to 6, and in carbonic oxide, oxygen is present
  with carbon in the proportion of 8 to 6, 1 to 8 being also the
  proportions in which hydrogen and oxygen combine with each other. The
  theory that these <i>proportional numbers</i> are, in fact, nothing else
  but the relative weights of atoms so far accounts for the phenomena that
  the existence of these laws might have been predicted by the aid of the
  atomic hypothesis long before they were actually discovered by analysis.
  In themselves, however, the laws do not prove the theory of the existence
  of ultimate particles of matter of a certain relative weight; and
  although many chemists, even without expressly adopting the atomic theory
  itself, have followed Dalton in the use of the terms <i>atom</i> and
  <i>atomic weight</i>, in preference to <i>proportion</i>, <i>combining
  weight</i>, <i>equivalent</i>, and the like, yet in using the word
  <i>atom</i> it should be held in mind that it merely denotes the
  combining weights of the elements. These will remain the same whether the
  atomic hypothesis which suggested the employment of the term be true or
  false. Dalton supposed that the atoms are spherical, and invented certain
  symbols to represent the mode in which he conceived they might combine.
  The latest atomic hypothesis is one which assigns an electrical structure
  to the atom. See <i>Chemistry</i>; <i>Electricity</i>; <i>Matter</i>. Cf.

  <p><b>Atomists.</b> See <i>Atoms</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Atoms</b>, for many years regarded as the ultimate indivisible
  particles of the chemical elements. The idea originated with some of the
  ancient philosophers (the atomists), more especially Democritus (450
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), Epicurus, and Lucretius (99-55 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>), and was developed into a definite theory by
  Dalton (1804). According to Dalton the atoms of any one element are alike
  in all their properties, but differ from the atoms of other elements, and
  when chemical combination occurs it takes place between the atoms of the
  combining elements (see <i>Chemistry</i>). Various views have been held
  with regard to the nature of atoms. Newton regarded them as hard,
  ponderable particles, perfectly unalterable, and concluded that the
  difference between substances was due to different kinds of atoms. Lord
  Kelvin propounded the view that the properties of atoms might be
  explained by those of vortices or vortex rings in a homogeneous
  frictionless fluid. As a result of the researches of British and French
  physicists on radium, the latest view is that matter and electricity are
  closely connected, that atoms are not indivisible, but complex aggregates
  containing positive and negative electrons, the differences between the
  atoms depending mainly on the numbers of these electrons and their
  velocity. See <i>Radium</i>.</p>
